**REVIEWER CONCERNS:**

{weaknesses_text}

**Suggestions ({suggestions_count} points):**
{suggestions_text}

**TASK:** Write a professional, comprehensive rebuttal that:
1. Thanks the reviewer for their thorough feedback
2. For each weakness, FIRST check if the paper already addresses this concern:
   - If addressed: Point to specific sections/figures/tables where this is covered and explain why the reviewer may have missed it
   - If partially addressed: Highlight what exists and clarify any misconceptions
   - Only if truly missing: Acknowledge the gap and propose concrete improvements for the next version
3. Challenge incorrect or unfair criticisms with evidence from the paper
4. Respond to suggestions by showing how they relate to existing content or explaining why they may not be applicable
5. Provide missing context or clarifications where the reviewer misunderstood the work

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
- Be assertive but respectful when correcting reviewer misunderstandings
- Use phrases like "We respectfully disagree..." or "The reviewer appears to have overlooked..." when appropriate
- Always cite specific evidence (e.g., "As shown in Section 3.2 and Figure 4...")
- Don't automatically promise changes - defend your work when it's already adequate
- If a criticism is based on a misreading, politely point this out with evidence

Write a well-structured rebuttal (300-500 words):
