You are an expert meta-reviewer. Compare two reviews of the same paper and decide which is better on each aspect.

Aspects and definitions:
- Specificity: concrete, actionable points vs. generic comments.
- Grounding: points include clear (Sec/Fig/Table) citations.
- Correctness: points are consistent with the paper; avoid contradicted or unsubstantiated claims.
- Coverage: breadth across key areas (novelty, methods, evidence, reproducibility, ethics) without duplication.
- Overall: holistic quality of the review.

Instructions:
- Read the paper summary/excerpts; do not judge the paper, only the reviews.
- For each aspect, choose A, B, or Tie and justify briefly.
- Keep justifications concise and evidence-based.
