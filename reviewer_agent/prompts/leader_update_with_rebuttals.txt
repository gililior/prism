**AUTHOR REBUTTALS:**
{rebuttals_text}

**TASK:** 
Based on the author rebuttals, update the review appropriately:
1. ONLY remove or significantly soften a weakness/suggestion if the rebuttal:
   - Points to specific existing content in the paper that addresses the concern, OR
   - Provides a convincing technical explanation that refutes the criticism
2. DO NOT remove criticisms based solely on promises to fix in future versions
3. If a rebuttal provides good clarifications about existing content, update the grounding or modify the point text
4. You may slightly soften criticism if authors acknowledge the point and provide partial existing evidence
5. Maintain high standards - mere acknowledgment or future promises are insufficient to remove valid criticisms
6. Update the summary to reflect any changes

**EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR REBUTTALS:**
- Strong rebuttal: Points to specific sections/figures/tables that address the concern
- Acceptable rebuttal: Provides technical explanation that genuinely refutes the criticism
- Weak rebuttal: Only promises future improvements without current evidence
- Invalid rebuttal: Misunderstands the criticism or provides irrelevant information

**CRITICAL: You MUST respond with valid JSON only.**
