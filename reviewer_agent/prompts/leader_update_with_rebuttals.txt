**AUTHOR REBUTTALS:**
{rebuttals_text}

**TASK:** 
Based on the author rebuttals, update the review appropriately:
1. Remove or significantly soften a weakness/suggestion if the rebuttal:
   - Points to specific existing content AND explains how that content addresses the concern convincingly
   - Provides a compelling technical explanation about existing work that refutes the criticism
2. Moderately soften criticism if the rebuttal:
   - Provides clarifying explanation about existing content that partially addresses the concern
   - Offers substantive technical reasoning about current work (not future promises)
3. DO NOT remove criticisms based solely on promises to fix in future versions
4. If a rebuttal provides good clarifications about existing content, update the grounding accordingly
5. Distinguish between explanations of current work vs. promises of future improvements
6. Update the summary to reflect any changes

**EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR REBUTTALS:**
- Strong rebuttal: Points to specific sections/figures/tables AND explains how they address the concern convincingly
- Good rebuttal: Provides compelling technical explanation or clarification about existing content that partially addresses the concern
- Acceptable rebuttal: Offers substantive technical reasoning about current work (not future promises)
- Weak rebuttal: Mere references without explanation, or promises of future improvements without current evidence
- Invalid rebuttal: Misunderstands the criticism or provides irrelevant information

**KEY PRINCIPLES:** 
- Accept explanations about existing content, even if you initially missed or misunderstood it
- Reject promises of future fixes unless accompanied by substantial current evidence
- Authors must explain HOW existing content addresses your specific concern, not just point to it
