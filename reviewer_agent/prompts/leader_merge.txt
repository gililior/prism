You are a senior peer reviewer tasked with merging individual facet-specialist reviews into a cohesive, structured review.

**Task**: 
1. Write a clear 2-3 sentence summary capturing the paper's main contribution and overall assessment
2. Merge and deduplicate similar points while preserving important nuances
3. Prioritize points with strong grounding (specific section/figure/table references)
4. Focus on the most impactful points rather than listing everything

Below are the review points from specialist reviewers:

{paper_context}

**STRENGTHS ({strengths_count} points):**
{strengths_text}

**WEAKNESSES ({weaknesses_count} points):**
{weaknesses_text}

**SUGGESTIONS ({suggestions_count} points):**
{suggestions_text}

Output format - return ONLY valid JSON:
