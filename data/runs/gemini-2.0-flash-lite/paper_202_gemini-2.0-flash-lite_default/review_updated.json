  "summary": "This paper investigates the impact of linguistic properties of prompts on LLM performance, a valuable but under-explored area. The study design is a strength. The authors have addressed some of the weaknesses in the original review, particularly regarding clarity and reproducibility. However, the paper still needs to address statistical rigor and dataset licensing.",
