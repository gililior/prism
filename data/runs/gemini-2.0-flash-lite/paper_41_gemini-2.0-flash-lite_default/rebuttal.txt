    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort taken to review our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Overclaiming Generalizability (Sec 6):** We acknowledge the reviewer's concern regarding the limitations of the oracle ASR system. We agree that this impacts the generalizability of our findings. The reviewer is correct in pointing this out. We have already addressed this in Section 6, where we explicitly state the need for a more realistic evaluation framework using a real ASR system. We will strengthen this discussion by adding a more explicit caveat about the limitations of the oracle ASR in the abstract and conclusion. We will also add a sentence in the abstract to highlight that we will address this limitation in future work.\n\n*   **Lack of Detail on Audio Features and Pipeline (Abstract, Intro):** We believe the reviewer may have overlooked the details provided. The abstract and introduction provide a high-level overview, but Section 2.2 and Appendix A.1 describe the audio features and the pipeline. We will revise the abstract and introduction to more explicitly mention these sections and briefly summarize the key aspects of the audio feature extraction process to improve clarity. We will also add a sentence in the introduction to highlight that the audio features used are described in Section 2.2 and Appendix A.1.\n\n*   **Insufficient Detail on Experimental Setup (Abstract, ยง1):** We believe the reviewer may have overlooked the details provided. The experimental setup is described in Section 4 and Appendix A.2. We will add a dedicated subsection in Section 4 to explicitly detail the experimental methodology, including the specific audio features used, the models employed, and the evaluation metrics, as suggested by the reviewer. We will also add a sentence in the abstract to highlight that the experimental setup is described in Section 4 and Appendix A.2.\n\n*   **Missing Seeds and Variance (Section 4 and Appendix A):** We acknowledge the lack of seed values and variance reporting. This is a valid point. We will include the seed values used for all experiments and report the standard deviation of the results across multiple runs with different seeds in the next version of the paper. This will be added to Section 4 and Appendix A.\n\n*   **Figure and Table Deficiencies (Fig 2, Tables 1 and 3):** We agree with the reviewer's assessment. We will add axis labels with units to Figure 2 and include a legend to clarify the different components or configurations being compared. We will also include standard deviations and/or confidence intervals for all reported metrics in all tables. We will add p-values to Table 2 to indicate the statistical significance of performance differences between models.\n\n*   **Dataset License and Usage Restrictions:** We will add explicit license and consent statements for the datasets used in the next version of the paper.\n\n*   **Lack of Discussion on Biases and Societal Impacts:** We acknowledge the importance of addressing potential biases and societal impacts. We will add a Broader Impact section with mitigation strategies in the conclusion, as suggested by the reviewer.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Experiments with Real ASR (Sec 6):** We agree with the reviewer's suggestion and have already planned this for future work, as stated in Section 6. We will emphasize this point in the conclusion.\n\n*   **Detailed Description of Audio Features (Sec 3.1):** We believe the reviewer may have overlooked the details provided. The audio features are described in Section 2.2 and Appendix A.1. We will revise the abstract and introduction to more explicitly mention these sections and briefly summarize the key aspects of the audio feature extraction process to improve clarity.\n\n*   **Comparison with Existing Methods (Related Work, Sec 4.1):** We believe the reviewer may have overlooked the details provided. We have already included a comparison with existing argument mining methods in the introduction and related work section. We will strengthen this comparison by adding more details about the baselines used in the experiments and explain the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.\n\n*   **Seed Values and Variance (All sections):** We will include the seed values used for all experiments and report the standard deviation of the results across multiple runs with different seeds in the next version of the paper. This will be added to Section 4 and Appendix A.\n\n*   **Figure and Table Improvements (Fig 2, Tables 1, 2, and 3):** We will implement the suggested improvements to Figure 2 and Tables 1, 2, and 3.\n\n*   **License and Consent Statements:** We will add explicit license and consent statements for the datasets used in the next version of the paper.\n\n*   **Dedicated Section on Experimental Methodology (Abstract, ยง1):** We will add a dedicated subsection in Section 4 to explicitly detail the experimental methodology, including the specific audio features used, the models employed, and the evaluation metrics, as suggested by the reviewer.\n\n*   **Broader Impact Section (Conclusion):** We will add a Broader Impact section with mitigation strategies in the conclusion, as suggested by the reviewer.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our paper. We are grateful for the reviewer's guidance and look forward to incorporating their feedback."
