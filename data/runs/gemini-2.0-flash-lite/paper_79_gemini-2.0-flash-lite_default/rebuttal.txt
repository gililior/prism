    "rebuttal": "We sincerely appreciate the reviewer's thorough and insightful feedback. We have carefully considered each point and provide detailed responses below.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Weakness 1: Lack of details on 'previous methods' (Abstract).** The reviewer is correct that the abstract could be more specific. While the abstract mentions previous methods, it doesn't provide explicit details. We will revise the abstract to include a brief mention of the limitations of existing methods like edit distance and semantic similarity measures, which are discussed in Sections 3.2 and 4.4. This will clarify the improvement offered by our PerturbScorer.\n\n*   **Weakness 2: Overclaiming generalizability (Section 4.4).** We respectfully disagree. Section 4.5.2 and Table 4 explicitly demonstrate the PerturbScorer's generalization across datasets (IMDB, AG's News), perturbation methods (Textfooler, randomperturb), and models (BERT, FreeLB-trained BERT). We believe the results, especially the correlation scores in Table 4, provide sufficient evidence. We will, however, add a sentence to Section 4.4 emphasizing the need for further validation on more diverse datasets and perturbation types in future work.\n\n*   **Weakness 3: Lack of clarity on PerturbScore (Abstract, Introduction).** The reviewer is correct that the abstract and introduction could benefit from more detail. We will revise the abstract and introduction to briefly explain that the PerturbScore is a regression task designed to predict the norm-bound (epsilon) of the continuous perturbation, given a discrete perturbation. The loss function is the Mean Squared Error (MSE), and the architecture is a simple feed-forward network, as described in Section 3.5. We will clarify this in the revised version.\n\n*   **Weakness 4: Lack of a clear notation section (Methods Section).** We acknowledge this omission. We will include a dedicated notation section in the revised paper to define all key variables, including those related to perturbations (δ, P(S), ε) and the PerturbScorer (M). This will significantly improve clarity.\n\n*   **Weakness 5: Lack of statistical measures (Tables 1, 3, 4, 5).** We acknowledge the need for more rigorous statistical analysis. We will include standard deviations and, where appropriate, confidence intervals in Tables 3, 4, and 5 to better illustrate the significance of our results. We will also clarify the metrics used in Table 1.\n\n*   **Weakness 6: Lack of ethical risk discussion (Insufficient evidence).** We acknowledge this critical omission. We will add a new section to discuss potential ethical risks, such as the potential misuse of the PerturbScorer for generating adversarial examples or manipulating NLP models. We will also outline mitigation strategies, such as emphasizing responsible use and providing guidelines for ethical application.\n\n*   **Weakness 7: Lack of dataset information (Insufficient evidence).** We acknowledge this omission. We will add a section detailing the datasets used, their licenses (if applicable), and any relevant usage restrictions. We will also address any consent and privacy measures, if applicable.\n\n*   **Weakness 8: No seed reporting (Sec 3.1).** We will include the random seed used in our experiments in Section 3.1 to ensure reproducibility.\n\n*   **Weakness 9: Unclear axes labels and missing legend (Figure 1).** We acknowledge this. We will revise Figure 1 to include clear labels for all axes, including units, and add a legend to identify the different curves and data points. The figure will be improved for clarity.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Suggestion 1: Release code and scripts.** We plan to release our code and generated datasets upon publication. We will include a GitHub link in the final version.\n\n*   **Suggestion 2: Detailed comparison with existing methods.** We believe this is partially addressed in Section 4.4, where we compare the correlation results of PerturbScorer with edit distance, BERTScore, and USE. We will expand this comparison in the revised version, providing more quantitative results and analysis.\n\n*   **Suggestion 3: Dataset details.** This will be addressed by adding a new section as described above.\n\n*   **Suggestion 4: Ethical risk discussion.** This will be addressed by adding a new section as described above.\n\n*   **Suggestion 5: Experiments on a wider range of datasets.** While we agree this would strengthen our claims, it is beyond the scope of the current work. We will include this as a future direction in the conclusion.\n\n*   **Suggestion 6: Detailed explanation of PerturbScore.** This will be addressed by clarifying the loss function, architecture, and training procedure in the abstract, introduction, and methods section.\n\n*   **Suggestion 7: Notation table.** This will be addressed by adding a new section as described above.\n\n*   **Suggestion 8: Statistical significance.** This will be addressed by including standard deviations and confidence intervals in the tables.\n\n*   **Suggestion 9: Potential misuse scenarios and mitigation.** This will be addressed by adding a new section as described above.\n\n*   **Suggestion 10: Clear labels and legend for Figure 1.** This will be addressed by revising Figure 1 as described above.\n\nWe believe these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
