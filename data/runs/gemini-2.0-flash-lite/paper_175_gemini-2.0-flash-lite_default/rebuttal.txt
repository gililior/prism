    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Dataset Consent, Privacy, Usage Terms, and Ethical Risk Assessment:** The reviewer correctly points out the lack of explicit discussion on these critical aspects. We acknowledge this omission. In the next version, we will include a new section titled \"Ethical Considerations and Broader Impact\" in the conclusion. This section will explicitly state the data sources (SnifferBench and TriviaQA), the licensing terms (SnifferBench's terms of use, TriviaQA is publicly available), and address potential ethical risks, including misuse of the detection method and the potential for biased detection. We will also outline mitigation strategies, such as emphasizing the limitations of the method and the importance of responsible use.\n\n*   **Figure 4 Labels and Legends:** We acknowledge the reviewer's concern regarding the clarity of Figure 4. The figure already includes labels for the axes (Perplexity Range and Score Range) and a legend that identifies the sentence origins (AI-generated and human-created) and the detection methods (log p(x) and DetectGPT). However, we agree that the legend could be more explicit. In the revised version, we will enhance the legend to clearly differentiate the sentence origins and detection methods and add error bars to show confidence intervals.\n\n*   **Statistical Information in Tables:** The reviewer is correct that Tables 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 lack statistical information such as standard deviations, confidence intervals, and p-values. We will address this in the revised version by including standard deviations and, where appropriate, confidence intervals to provide a measure of result variability. We will also add p-values to indicate the statistical significance of the differences in performance between the different methods.\n\n*   **SeqXGPT Explanation and Connection to Speech Processing:** The reviewer is correct that the introduction of \"SeqXGPT\" and its connection to speech processing could be clearer. The \"X\" in SeqXGPT refers to the \"eXtraction\" of features from multiple LLMs. We will clarify this in the abstract and introduction. The connection to speech processing is based on the wave-like nature of the log probability lists. We will elaborate on this connection in the introduction, providing a more detailed explanation of how the temporal features extracted from the log probability lists are analogous to waves in speech processing. We will also include a visual example in the revised version.\n\n*   **Definition of \"Wave-like Features\":** The reviewer is correct that the definition of \"wave-like features\" could be clearer. We will expand the explanation of \"wave-like features\" in the introduction. We will clarify that these features are the word-wise log probability lists, which exhibit fluctuations across words, similar to the waveforms in speech processing. We will also include a visual example in the revised version.\n\n*   **Dataset Construction Process:** The reviewer is correct that the dataset construction process could be clearer. We will add a dedicated subsection within Section 3.2, \"Dataset Construction,\" to provide a more detailed explanation of the LLMs used (GPT-2, GPT-Neo, GPT-J, LLaMA, and GPT-3.5-turbo) and the criteria for sentence selection. This will include details on how the prompts were generated and the instructions used for GPT-3.5-turbo.\n\n*   **Potential Misuse or Failure Modes:** We acknowledge the lack of discussion on potential misuse or failure modes. This will be addressed in the new \"Ethical Considerations and Broader Impact\" section in the conclusion.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Data Sources and Licensing Terms:** We will explicitly state the data sources (SnifferBench and TriviaQA) and the licensing terms in the new \"Ethical Considerations and Broader Impact\" section.\n\n*   **Ethical Risks and Mitigation Strategies:** We will add a section addressing potential ethical risks and mitigation strategies in the conclusion.\n\n*   **Consent for Human-Written Text:** The human-written text is sourced from SnifferBench and TriviaQA, which are publicly available datasets. We will clarify this in the revised version and explain that consent was not required as the data is publicly available.\n\n*   **Figure 4 Enhancements:** We will add clear labels to the axes, including units where applicable, and include a comprehensive legend that clearly identifies the different sentence origins and detection methods. We will also consider using error bars to show confidence intervals in performance plots.\n\n*   **Statistical Information in Tables:** We will include standard deviations or confidence intervals to provide a measure of result variability. We will add p-values to indicate the statistical significance of the differences in performance between the different methods. We will also clearly define all acronyms and abbreviations used in the table headers and captions.\n\n*   **SeqXGPT Explanation:** We will provide a more detailed explanation of the 'X' in SeqXGPT and its significance in the abstract and introduction.\n\n*   **Wave-like Features Explanation:** We will elaborate on the connection between log probability lists and \"wave-like features,\" perhaps with a visual example in the introduction.\n\n*   **Dataset Creation Process:** We will include a section or subsection detailing the dataset creation process, including the LLMs used and the criteria for sentence selection in Section 3.2.\n\n*   **Acronym Definitions:** We will define all acronyms at first use.\n\n*   **Broader Impact Section:** We will add a Broader Impact section with mitigation strategies in the conclusion.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, completeness, and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
