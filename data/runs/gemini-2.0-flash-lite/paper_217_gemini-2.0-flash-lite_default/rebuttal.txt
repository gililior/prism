    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our work. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Reproducibility and Computational Resources:** The reviewer notes the absence of seeds, variance, and computational resource details. We acknowledge this as a valid point. While we did not explicitly state the random seeds used, we will include them in the next version of the paper and the code repository. We also plan to add a section in the appendix detailing the computational resources used, including the specific LLM API versions and hardware specifications. We believe the reviewer may have overlooked that we do provide details on the model used (GPT-4) in the abstract and throughout the paper. (Sections 4, 5, and Appendices D, G)\n\n*   **Comparison to Existing Bias Detection Methods and Generalizability:** The reviewer suggests a comparison to existing bias detection methods. We respectfully disagree that this is entirely missing. While our primary focus is on a novel framework for characterizing and evaluating LLM simulations, we do discuss related work on bias and stereotypes in Section 3.2 and cite relevant papers (e.g., Cheng et al., 2023b). We also acknowledge that our work is a pilot study (Section 10) and that our findings may not be universally generalizable. We will clarify this in the limitations section and add a more explicit discussion of how our approach complements existing bias detection methods, emphasizing that CoMPosT offers a simulation-specific lens. We will also expand the evaluation to include a wider range of LLMs and simulation contexts to strengthen the generalizability of the findings.\n\n*   **Statistical Analysis of Nuanced Relationships:** The reviewer suggests that our conclusions about nuanced relationships could be overstated without more detailed statistical analysis. We acknowledge this concern. In the next version, we will include statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA or t-tests) to compare the exaggeration scores across different topics and personas, as well as correlation analyses to quantify the relationships between topic specificity and exaggeration. (Figure A4)\n\n*   **Figure Clarity:** The reviewer points out the lack of clear axis labels, units, and legends in Figures A4 and A5. We agree that this is a valid point. We will revise these figures to include clear axis labels, units (where applicable), and comprehensive legends to improve clarity and interpretability. (Figures A4, A5)\n\n*   **Definition of Caricature and Measurement:** The reviewer requests a more precise definition of 'caricature' and its measurement. We believe the reviewer may have overlooked that we provide a detailed definition of caricature in Section 3.1, building upon existing literature (Lynch, 1927; Perkins, 1975). We define caricature using two criteria: individuation and exaggeration. We also explain how we measure these criteria in Sections 4.2 and 4.3. We will add a more formal definition of caricature and its components in the abstract and introduction to improve clarity.\n\n*   **Statistical Significance:** The reviewer notes the absence of standard deviations, confidence intervals, or p-values. We acknowledge this as a valid point. We will include standard deviations or confidence intervals in all relevant figures and tables. We will also add p-values to indicate the statistical significance of our findings, particularly in the analysis of exaggeration scores. (Figures A4, A5, and Tables A3, A4, A5, A6)\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Seeds, Variance, and Computational Resources:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Comparative Analysis:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Quantitative Evaluation of Metrics:** We believe the reviewer may have overlooked that we already provide quantitative evaluation of the individuation and exaggeration metrics. We will add statistical tests to support the claims.\n\n*   **Statistical Analyses:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Wider Range of LLMs and Contexts:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Formal Definition of Caricature:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Figure Clarity:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Contextualized Semantic Axis:** We will elaborate on the methodology for constructing and using the 'contextualized semantic axis' and include examples in Section 4.3.\n\n*   **Notation Table:** We will include a table summarizing the notation used throughout the paper to improve readability.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our work. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
