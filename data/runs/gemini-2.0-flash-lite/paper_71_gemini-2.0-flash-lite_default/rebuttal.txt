    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of detailed comparison with existing methods:** We respectfully disagree. Section 2 (Related Work) provides a comprehensive overview of existing methods, including those using NLP techniques and argumentation theory. We compare our method against several baselines, including Longformer (NLP) and argumentation theory-based approaches (Naïve-ATB and Preferred-ATB) in Section 5.2. The delta between our method and the best baseline is clearly established in Table 1, where the Naïve-GN outperforms all other methods. The reviewer may have overlooked this section.\n\n*   **Overclaiming novelty:** We acknowledge that our method builds upon existing architectures. However, the novelty lies in the *combination* of these architectures with argumentation theory concepts to address a novel task: predicting the winning stance in *complete professional debates*. This is explicitly stated in the Abstract and Introduction. We believe the hybrid approach, integrating argumentation frameworks with Transformer embeddings and GNNs, is a significant contribution to the field.\n\n*   **Limitations analysis:** We partially addressed this. Section 5.4 (Results) and Section 6 (Discussion) discuss limitations, particularly the reliance on corpus size. We will expand this discussion in the next version to include a more in-depth analysis of the impact of corpus size and domain-specific limitations.\n\n*   **Figure axes labels:** The reviewer is correct. We will add clear labels and units to the axes in Figure 2 in the next version.\n\n*   **Data ethics:** This was an omission. We will add a section in the next version detailing the data source (VivesDebate corpus), including information on consent, privacy measures, and usage terms. We will also address ethical risks.\n\n*   **Definition of \"hybrid method\":** We partially addressed this. The Abstract and Introduction mention the combination of argumentation theory and NLP. We will clarify the specific components and their integration in Section 4 (Method) and add a dedicated subsection to detail the methodology.\n\n*   **Definition of \"complete argumentative debates\":** We partially addressed this. The Introduction defines the context of professional debates. We will add a more precise definition, emphasizing the inclusion of all phases and lines of reasoning, in the Introduction.\n\n*   **Table 1 lacks statistical information:** The reviewer is correct. We will include standard deviations and the number of trials in Table 1 in the next version to provide a more robust assessment of the results.\n\n*   **Model risks and societal impact:** This was an omission. We will add a section in the next version discussing potential risks, fairness concerns, misuse possibilities, and broader societal impacts, along with proposed mitigation strategies.\n\n*   **Comparison with DebateSum and Disputool 2.0:** We acknowledge the lack of direct comparison. Due to the different nature of our task (professional debates) and the limited availability of suitable datasets, a direct comparison was not possible. However, we will discuss the relationship of our work with these approaches in the Related Work section and explain the differences in scope and data.\n\n*   **Architectural choices:** We partially addressed this. Section 4.2 (Phase II: Debate Outcome Estimation) describes the use of a Graph Network (GN) architecture and Transformer-based sentence embeddings. We will provide a more detailed discussion of the specific architectural choices within the Transformer-based and neural graph network components, clarifying how the argumentation framework is integrated with these neural components, in the next version.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Direct comparison with NLP and argumentation theory methods:** We have already done this in Section 5.2 (Baselines) and Table 1. We will strengthen the discussion in the Related Work section.\n\n*   **Ablation study:** Due to the limited size of our dataset, a full ablation study was not feasible. However, we will consider this for future work when a larger dataset becomes available.\n\n*   **Error analysis:** We partially addressed this in Section 5.5 (Error Analysis) and Figure 2. We will expand this analysis in the next version.\n\n*   **Error bars in Figure 2:** We will add error bars to the confusion matrices in Figure 2 in the next version.\n\n*   **Data source details:** We will add a detailed description of the data sources, including any relevant licenses or terms of use, and consent process in the next version.\n\n*   **Detailed explanation of the method:** We will add a dedicated subsection to the methodology, detailing the specific steps of the proposed hybrid method, in the next version.\n\n*   **Standard deviations and confidence intervals in Table 1:** We will include standard deviations and the number of trials in Table 1 in the next version.\n\n*   **Model risks and societal impact:** We will add a section discussing the potential for the model to be used to spread misinformation or to reinforce existing biases, propose mitigation strategies, address fairness considerations and the potential for misuse of the model, and discuss the broader societal impacts of the model in the next version.\n\n*   **Experiments with DebateSum and Disputool 2.0:** We will discuss the relationship of our work with these approaches in the Related Work section and explain the differences in scope and data.\n\n*   **Ablation study:** Due to the limited size of our dataset, a full ablation study was not feasible. However, we will consider this for future work when a larger dataset becomes available.\n\nWe believe these revisions will significantly improve the clarity and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
