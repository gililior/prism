      "paper_topic_and_main_contributions": "This paper proposes a new method to evaluate natural language debates based on a hybrid approach of combining argumentation theory and NLP techniques. The approach taken seems to be an interesting one, with the potential of leveraging the improvements made in both fields to perform the challenging task of debate outcome prediction. The model used is, to my knowledge, an original one and comparisons are made to reasonable baselines although some details are missing. The two phase approach taken to argument scoring is another good contribution.",
      "reasons_to_accept": "1. Interesting two phase approach to argument quality detection. \n2. Innovative model proposed to handle debate outcome prediction,",
      "reasons_to_reject": "There are some decisions taken by the author/s that I would like some clarifications on, as to my understanding, they impact the outcome of the paper in a major way. \n1. The removal of arguments that have an attack relation on them prior to them being scored strikes me as being quite extreme. There may be a good argument that has a substandard attack on it. Removal of that argument from the set of admissible arguments is likely to make the model non representative, as human adjudicators may still credit the argument. It may also be the case that an argument is too bad to be attacked. Most debates have a defined time for speakers to rebut their opposition and often the arguments that are focused on are the ones most fundamental to the case that the opposition is running. It makes little sense at that point to spend valuable time on rebutting throwaway statements. In the case of the method proposed by the authors, a good argument that is rebutted badly would be inadmissible and a bad argument that is deemed not worth rebutting would be admissible. This may cause issues in the subsequent steps. \n2. I am unclear on how arguments impact the probability of winning the debate. While section 4.2 is titled argument scoring, I am not clear where that process is actually happening.",
      "questions_for_the_authors": "A. How is the removal of arguments having an attack relation on them justified? \nB. Question on extension of work - often debates are not neatly categorized into phases of speech and rebuttal - how does this architecture handle that?",

      "paper_topic_and_main_contributions": "The article presents an original method for evaluating the winning stance in complete debates, under real-world circumstances involving professional debaters. The proposed method is a hybrid approach that combines argumentation frameworks and semantics on one side, and Graph-Network and Transformer-based architectures on the other.\nThe argumentation frameworks module categorizes arguments as either Conflict-free or Admissible. Subsequently, the arguments are processed by a hybrid model that integrates a Graph-Network architecture with embeddings generated by a Transformer model. The winner is estimated as the participant with the highest count of acceptable arguments.",
      "reasons_to_accept": "- This work achieved results surpass those previously reported in the literature for this task.\n- Detailed analyses present original and interesting outcomes of argumentation processing. The realization that \"learning representations from graph-structured data is a better idea than just using the whole text\" holds significant importance within the current context of NLP research, wherein generative LLMs are garnering widespread attention.\n- The incorporation of error analysis enriched the discussions.\n- The text provides a concise and well-structured literature review on automatic debate processing.",
      "reasons_to_reject": "- Despite the strengths of the proposed work, the attained F1 score by the best model still appears relatively low. As a matter of fact, this is not a poor outcome when considering the conventional models employed for the task, but it's possible that the proposed model might be outperformed by newer Generative LLMs. It would be important to discuss the influence of these novel models on the task's execution.",
      "questions_for_the_authors": "- You wrote that \"both baselines relying exclusively on NLP algorithms and techniques performed worse than the random baseline. The main cause of this problem can be probably attributed to the lack of data in our domain\". But did you consider testing simpler probabilistic models for NLP, such as a Bayesian classifier, which performs well with small datasets?\n- Did you consider comparing the results of your method with those of a generative LLM, which have been widely used for complex NLP tasks?",

      "paper_topic_and_main_contributions": "This paper proposes a new method for automatically evaluating and predicting the winning stance in professional argumentative debates. The key problem it addresses is performing debate analysis and evaluation on complex natural language arguments, which have been relatively unexplored.  The main contributions are: - Introduces a hybrid technique combining concepts from argumentation theory and NLP to model complete reasoning lines in debates and determine a winning stance.\n- Demonstrates superior performance of the hybrid technique over pure NLP or argumentation theory baselines on the debate evaluation task.\n- Provides detailed experimental analysis and error analysis lending insight into the benefits of combining logical and linguistic knowledge for this problem.\nOverall, this engineering-focused paper makes contributions in methods, and analysis towards advancing NLP for a complex argumentation problem.",
      "reasons_to_accept": "- Tackles a complex and underexplored NLP problem - evaluation of professional debates with complete logical argumentation - using a hybrid approach.\n- The details of the hybrid technique combining concepts from argumentation theory seem sound and applicable to debates.  - Well-written with a clear explanation of all concepts for audiences unfamiliar with argumentation theory.\n- Provides compelling evidence that bridging logical and neural techniques is beneficial for argument-mining problems.\n- Could inspire more creative hybrid modelling and use of structured knowledge in NLP systems.",
      "reasons_to_reject": "My biggest issue with this paper is the lack of comparison to other techniques for the debate evaluation task, which makes it difficult to situate the novelty of the proposed approach. The authors only compare against baselines they define, without discussing prior proposals from the literature. Given the lack of comparisons, it is unclear whether this approach substantially advances upon the state-of-the-art for this task.   Additionally, the literature review overlooks highly relevant prior work. The authors claim in line 110 that \"Most of this research has been focused on performing an individual evaluation of arguments or argumentative lines of reasoning (Wachsmuth et al., 2017) instead of a global, interactive viewpoint where complete debates consisting of multiple, conflicting lines of reasoning are analysed\". However, Wachsmuth et al. (2017) proposed a Reasonableness dimension that evaluates the whole argument, considering counter-arguments and rebuttals. In a debate scenario, counter-arguments and rebuttals are what constitute the bare bones of it so one would imagine that a dimension like Reasonableness would at least be discussed. Furthermore, Marro et al. (2022) also introduced a technique to assess the reasonableness of full argument graphs, combining text and graph structure. Yet neither of these directly related works are acknowledged or compared to. The lack of citations and comparisons to existing techniques that also evaluate full argument graphs raises concerns. The paper does not sufficiently situate its contributions among prior methods or demonstrate advancement over closely related approaches. A more rigorous review and comparison to previous debate evaluation and reasonableness assessment research is needed.",
      "questions_for_the_authors": "A) Your proposed approach is evaluated only on a single dataset of Catalan debates. Can you discuss how you expect the hybrid technique to transfer to other debate domains and languages? Do you plan to test generalization capability on other debate datasets?",
