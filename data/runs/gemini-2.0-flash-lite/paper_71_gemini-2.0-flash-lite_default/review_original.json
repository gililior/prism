  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel hybrid approach for evaluating complete argumentative debates using graph neural networks, argumentation theory, and Transformer-based architectures. While the paper demonstrates promising results, particularly in comparison to baseline methods, it lacks sufficient detail regarding the novelty of the hybrid method and a thorough analysis of its limitations.",
