    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our paper and providing constructive criticism. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Insufficient comparative evidence against ChatGPT (Sec 4.1):** We respectfully disagree. Section 4.3, \"Evaluation as Interviews,\" explicitly details our comparison with ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) using detailed prompts. Figure 4 provides a visual comparison across multiple dimensions, and the results are discussed in Section 4.5. The reviewer may have overlooked this direct comparison. We will clarify this further in the revised manuscript by explicitly stating the quantitative results of the comparison in Section 4.5.\n\n*   **Lack of consent/privacy discussion:** We acknowledge this is a valid concern. While we selected historical figures and imaginary characters from publicly available Wikipedia pages (as stated in the Ethics Statement), we will expand the Ethics Statement to explicitly address the potential privacy implications of using LLMs to generate detailed scenes. We will clarify our data generation process and emphasize that we do not include any personal opinions or harmful data. We will also add a discussion on potential mitigation strategies for future work.\n\n*   **Privacy concerns related to scene generation:** This is related to the previous point. We will expand the Ethics Statement to address this concern, clarifying our data sources and generation process. We will also discuss potential mitigation strategies.\n\n*   **Figure 3 lacks clear axis labels:** The reviewer is correct. Figure 3 is a visualization of question diversity and does not have axis labels in the traditional sense. We will clarify the figure's purpose in the caption and improve the description in the text to avoid confusion.\n\n*   **Unclear definition of \"Experience Reconstruction\":** We acknowledge this weakness. We will provide a more formal definition of \"Experience Reconstruction\" in Section 3 and elaborate on the steps involved (Profile Collection, Scene Extraction, and Experience Completion) with more detailed explanations.\n\n*   **Lack of notation table:** We agree. We will include a notation table in the Appendix to define all symbols and acronyms used throughout the paper.\n\n*   **Lack of quantitative data in Tables 1, 3, 12, 13 and evaluation metrics for prompts:** We acknowledge that Tables 3, 12, and 13 primarily present qualitative examples. However, Table 1 provides data statistics. We will add quantitative metrics to Tables 3, 12, and 13 where possible, such as the number of turns and words per turn. Tables 4-11 present prompts, and we will include results of the prompts in the revised version.\n\n*   **Potential misuse cases not discussed:** We acknowledge this omission. We will add a section to the Ethics Statement discussing potential misuse cases, such as impersonation and the spread of misinformation, and propose mitigation strategies, such as watermarking or content moderation.\n\n*   **Fairness concerns not addressed:** We acknowledge this is an important consideration. We will add a section to the Ethics Statement addressing potential biases in the training data and evaluation methods.\n\n*   **Broader societal impacts not discussed:** We agree. We will expand the discussion in the Conclusion to include the potential benefits and risks of this technology, including its effects on social interactions and the spread of information.\n\n*   **Seeds for random number generators not mentioned:** We will include the random seeds used for all experiments in Section 4.2 to ensure reproducibility.\n\n*   **Variance of results not provided:** We will report the variance of the results in Section 4 to assess the statistical significance of our findings.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Include random seeds and variance:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Provide code repository/data/environment details:** We will provide a link to the code repository and specify the environment used for the experiments, including the versions of the libraries used, in Section 4.\n\n*   **Quantitative comparison with ChatGPT:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Ablation study:** While an ablation study is valuable, the limited data size (1K-2K scenes) and the focus on qualitative analysis make a full ablation study less informative. We will, however, clarify the impact of each component in the \"Experience Reconstruction\" process in Section 3.\n\n*   **Clarify sources/address privacy risks:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Add error bars/legend to Figure 4:** We will add error bars to Figure 4 to show confidence intervals and include a legend to explain the different colors and markers.\n\n*   **Detailed explanation of \"Experience Reconstruction\":** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Include a notation table:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Include quantitative metrics in Tables 3, 4-13:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Include a section on potential misuse cases:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Address fairness concerns:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Expand discussion of broader societal impacts:** Addressed above.\n\nWe believe these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
