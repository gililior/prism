  "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their insightful and detailed feedback, which has helped us identify areas for improvement in our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Overclaiming superiority (En-Fr ITST):** We acknowledge the reviewer's concern regarding the En-Fr ITST models in Figure 5. The reviewer is correct in pointing out that the performance of word-level and token-level ITST models is similar in this case. We will revise the text in Section 4.3 to explicitly acknowledge this exception and provide a more nuanced interpretation of the results, clarifying that while word-level policies generally outperform, the gains are less pronounced for ITST on En-Fr. We will also add a sentence to the conclusion to reflect this.\n\n*   **Lack of detailed comparison with baselines:** We respectfully disagree. While we do not include a head-to-head comparison with a specific contemporaneous SiMT model, we compare our word-level approach against token-level versions of Wait-k, MoE Wait-k, and ITST, which are all strong baselines. We believe this provides a comprehensive evaluation. We will clarify this in the revised version by explicitly stating that we are comparing against strong baselines and highlighting the improvements over these baselines in the introduction and abstract.\n\n*   **Missing seed and variance information:** The reviewer is correct that we did not explicitly mention the use of seeds or report the variance. We will add a sentence in Section 4.2 to specify that we used random seeds for all experiments and report the standard deviation of the BLEU scores in the tables (e.g., Table 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12) to provide a measure of variance.\n\n*   **Missing software environment information:** We acknowledge the reviewer's point. We will add a section in the appendix detailing the software environment, including the specific versions of libraries used (e.g., PyTorch, Transformers, SentencePiece) to enhance reproducibility.\n\n*   **Missing axis labels, units, and legends:** We agree with the reviewer. We will revise Figures 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11 to include clear axis labels, units (where applicable), and comprehensive legends to improve clarity and readability.\n\n*   **Incomplete tables (statistical measures):** We acknowledge the lack of statistical measures in the tables. We will include standard deviations, and confidence intervals in the tables to provide a more complete picture of the results.\n\n*   **Imprecise definition of 'fixed policy':** We will refine the definition of 'fixed policy' in Section 2.1 to be more precise, clarifying that it refers to policies with a pre-defined sequence of READ and WRITE operations.\n\n*   **Lack of a clear notation table:** We agree with the reviewer. We will add a notation table at the beginning of Section 3.1 to define all symbols and variables used in the paper, improving readability and understanding.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Head-to-head comparison with a strong, contemporaneous SiMT model:** As mentioned above, we believe our comparison against the token-level versions of Wait-k, MoE Wait-k, and ITST provides a strong evaluation. We will consider adding a direct comparison with a specific, recently published SiMT model if feasible within the scope of our resources. However, we believe that the current comparison is sufficient to demonstrate the advantages of our word-level approach.\n\n*   **Provide code, training scripts, and requirements file:** We are unable to release the code at this time due to resource constraints. However, we will provide more detailed training configurations in the appendix.\n\n*   **Specify random seeds and report variance:** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Add error bars and label axes:** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Include standard deviations, confidence intervals, and p-values:** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Detailed explanation of word-level latency metric:** We believe the word-level latency metric is well-explained in Section 3.2. We will consider adding a brief summary in the introduction to further clarify this concept.\n\n*   **Table summarizing differences between token-level and word-level policies:** We will add a table summarizing the key differences between token-level and word-level policies in the introduction.\n\n*   **Expand on experimental setup:** We believe the experimental setup is sufficiently detailed in Section 4.2. We will consider adding a sentence to the introduction to highlight the key aspects of the experimental setup.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
