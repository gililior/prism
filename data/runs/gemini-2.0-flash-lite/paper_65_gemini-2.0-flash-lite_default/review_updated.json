  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel word-level policy for simultaneous machine translation (SiMT), addressing limitations of subword-level approaches. The word-level policies demonstrate superior performance across various datasets and latency levels, supported by LM-fused attention. The authors have addressed some weaknesses in experimental rigor and clarity, but further improvements are still needed.",
