  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel word-level policy for simultaneous machine translation (SiMT), addressing limitations of subword-level approaches. The word-level policies demonstrate superior performance across various datasets and latency levels, supported by LM-fused attention. However, the paper needs to address weaknesses in experimental rigor and clarity to strengthen its claims.",
