    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We have carefully considered each point and provide the following responses:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Overclaiming Generalizability & Weakened Few-Shot Findings (Sec 5):** We acknowledge the reviewer's concern. While we show consistent improvements in zero-shot across 18 languages, we agree that the few-shot results are less pronounced. We address this in Section 3.1, where we state, \"Natural language explanations are less helpful in the few-shot setting.\" We believe this is due to the carefully curated few-shot examples. We will revise Section 5 (Conclusion) to more strongly emphasize the zero-shot benefits and the limitations in the few-shot setting.\n\n*   **Novelty of Explain-then-Translate & Comparison to Chen et al. (2023b):** We respectfully disagree that the novelty is not clearly articulated. We build upon Chen et al. (2023b) by expanding the evaluation from a single translation direction (C++ to Python) to 36 directions across 19 programming languages, including low-resource languages. We also introduce different explanation types (exp-lbl, exp-lbl-d). We will strengthen the discussion in the Introduction (Section 1) and Related Work (Section 4) by explicitly highlighting these differences and the broader scope of our evaluation. We will also add a sentence in the introduction to highlight the differences.\n\n*   **Lack of Detail on Explanation Types:** We believe the reviewer has overlooked the details provided. Section 2.1 clearly defines 'exp', 'exp-lbl', and 'exp-lbl-d'. Appendix C provides full prompt examples for each explanation type. We will add a brief summary table in Section 2.1 to further clarify the differences between the explanation types.\n\n*   **Figure Labels & Legends:** We acknowledge this weakness. We will revise all figures to include clear axis labels with units and comprehensive legends. We will pay special attention to the figures with performance plots.\n\n*   **Clarity of Explanation Generation (Sec 2.1):** We believe the reviewer has overlooked the details provided. Section 2.1 provides a definition of 'exp', 'exp-lbl', and 'exp-lbl-d'. We will add a brief summary table in Section 2.1 to further clarify the differences between the explanation types.\n\n*   **Lack of Notation Section:** We acknowledge this weakness. We will include a notation table in the Appendix to define all symbols and abbreviations used.\n\n*   **Misuse Scenarios, Fairness, & Broader Impacts:** We acknowledge these are important considerations. While a full discussion is beyond the scope of this paper, we will add a brief paragraph in the Conclusion (Section 5) to acknowledge these concerns and suggest future research directions.\n\n*   **Comparison to Starcoder (Chen et al., 2023b):** We respectfully disagree. The paper already compares to Starcoder. We will add a sentence in the related work to highlight the differences.\n\n*   **Limitations of Self-Generated Explanations:** We acknowledge this weakness. We will add a sentence in the related work to highlight the limitations.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Impact of Explanation Types & Heuristics:** We believe the reviewer has overlooked the details provided. Section 3.4 details the heuristics used, and Section 3.6 provides an ablation study on explanation variations. We will strengthen the discussion in these sections.\n\n*   **Head-to-Head Comparison with Chen et al. (2023b):** We will add a sentence in the introduction to highlight the differences.\n\n*   **Comparison with BNF Grammars (Wang et al., 2023a):** We will add a sentence in the related work to highlight the differences.\n\n*   **Dataset Licensing:** We will add explicit license and consent statements for datasets used.\n\n*   **Prompt Details (Sec 2.1):** We believe the reviewer has overlooked the details provided. Section 2.1 provides a definition of 'exp', 'exp-lbl', and 'exp-lbl-d'. We will add a brief summary table in Section 2.1 to further clarify the differences between the explanation types.\n\n*   **Notation Table:** We will include a notation table in the Appendix to define all symbols and abbreviations used.\n\n*   **Misuse Scenarios:** We will add a brief paragraph in the Conclusion (Section 5) to acknowledge these concerns and suggest future research directions.\n\n*   **Fairness Considerations:** We will add a brief paragraph in the Conclusion (Section 5) to acknowledge these concerns and suggest future research directions.\n\n*   **Broader Impacts:** We will add a brief paragraph in the Conclusion (Section 5) to acknowledge these concerns and suggest future research directions.\n\n*   **Ablation Study:** We believe the reviewer has overlooked the details provided. Section 3.6 provides an ablation study on explanation variations. We will strengthen the discussion in these sections.\n\n*   **Explanation Quality Metrics:** We will add a sentence in the related work to highlight the limitations."
