  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel approach to code-to-code translation using self-generated explanations, demonstrating improved translation quality and addressing limitations in existing benchmarks. The paper presents promising results, particularly in zero-shot settings. The authors have clarified the novelty of their approach and addressed some of the weaknesses raised in the initial review. However, some weaknesses remain, particularly regarding the generalizability of the findings and the need for more detailed comparisons.",
