    "rebuttal": "We thank the reviewer for their insightful and detailed feedback. We address each point below:\n\n**Weakness 1: Statistical Soundness**\nThe reviewer requests more detail on the statistical soundness of the behavior vector, including variance reporting and statistical significance. We acknowledge that the current version lacks explicit variance reporting and statistical significance tests. While we present average results across multiple runs and datasets, we did not include standard deviations or p-values. We will address this in the next version by:\n\n*   Calculating and reporting standard deviations or confidence intervals for key results in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. This will provide a clearer picture of the variability in our findings.\n*   Conducting statistical significance tests (e.g., t-tests or ANOVA) to compare the performance of different methods and configurations, especially when comparing the original model with our treatments. We will include p-values in the tables to indicate the statistical significance of observed differences.\n\n**Weakness 2: Comparison with Existing Methods and Broader Impacts**\nThe reviewer points out the lack of detailed comparison with existing methods for analyzing model behavior in other generation tasks and the absence of discussion on potential malicious use, bias, or broader impacts. We partially address the first part of this weakness. Section 2.3, \"Model Behavior: Existing Approaches,\" discusses existing XAI methods. However, we will expand this section to include a more detailed comparison with methods used in other generation tasks, highlighting the differences and challenges in applying them to program repair. We will also add a new section to address the second part of this weakness. We will include a discussion on potential misuse cases, such as the malicious generation of code vulnerabilities, and the potential for the model to create or exacerbate existing biases in software. We will also analyze the potential impact on software development practices and the workforce.\n\n**Weakness 3: Dataset and Model Details, Code/Data Availability**\nThe reviewer notes the lack of clear explanations of the datasets and models, and the absence of code/data availability information. We believe the paper provides sufficient detail on the datasets and models used. Table 1 provides a summary of the datasets and models, including their names, sizes, and key characteristics. The paper also references previous studies that used the same datasets and models (Berabi et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021). However, we acknowledge the lack of explicit mention of code/data availability. We will address this by adding a section in the next version that explicitly states the availability of our code and data, including a link to a public repository. We will also include instructions for environment setup and report the random seeds used to ensure reproducibility.\n\n**Weakness 4: Figure 3 and Definition of Behavior Vector**\nThe reviewer points out the lack of clear axis labels and units in Figure 3 and the lack of clarity in the definition of the behavior vector. We respectfully disagree with the assessment of Figure 3. Figure 3 is an illustration, and the purpose is to show the overall process. We will clarify the definition of the behavior vector in the abstract and introduction. We will also add a more detailed explanation of the behavior vector, including examples and a visual representation, in the next version.\n\n**Weakness 5: Tolerance Setting**\nThe reviewer correctly points out that the selection of appropriate tolerance is a human-driven process. We acknowledge this and address it in the \"Tolerance Setting\" section of the conclusion. We will clarify that the tolerance setting may vary across developmental environments and recommend deciding based on the experimental findings.\n\n**Suggestion 1: Comparison with Other XAI Methods**\nWe will expand Section 2.3 to include a more detailed comparison with other XAI methods on a benchmark dataset and conduct a comparative analysis with existing methods for analyzing model behavior in generation tasks.\n\n**Suggestion 2: Detailed Explanation of Behavior Vector**\nWe will provide a more detailed explanation of the behavior vector, including examples and a visual representation, and include a table summarizing the datasets, models, and evaluation metrics used.\n\n**Suggestion 3: Code Repository and Data Availability**\nWe will provide a link to the code repository and data used, including instructions for environment setup, report the random seeds used and the variance of key results, and add explicit license and consent statements for datasets used.\n\n**Suggestion 4: Statistical Analysis and Abbreviation Definitions**\nWe will include standard deviations or confidence intervals to quantify the variability of the results and add p-values to indicate the statistical significance of the observed differences between methods or configurations. We will clearly define all abbreviations used in the tables.\n\n**Suggestion 5: Potential Misuse Cases and Bias Discussion**\nWe will include a section on potential misuse cases, such as the malicious generation of code vulnerabilities, and discuss the potential for the model to be used to create or exacerbate existing biases in software, and analyze the potential impact on software development practices and the workforce.\n\nWe believe that addressing these points will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our work. We thank the reviewer again for their valuable feedback."
