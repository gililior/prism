  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel approach to identify false behaviors in transformer-based program repair models using a behavior vector. The study demonstrates improved performance with the proposed BeDisc and treatment strategies across multiple models and datasets. The authors have committed to addressing statistical soundness and broader impact concerns in the next version.",
