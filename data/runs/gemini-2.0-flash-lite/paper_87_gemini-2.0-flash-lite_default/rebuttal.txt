    "rebuttal": "We thank the reviewer for their insightful and detailed feedback. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Detailed Comparison with Das et al. (2022) and Van Aken et al. (2022):** The reviewer requests a more detailed comparison, including quantitative interpretability metrics. We believe our paper already provides a solid comparison in Section 6 (Related Works). We acknowledge the need for more quantitative metrics, and we will include a table in the next version that directly compares proto-lm with Das et al. (2022) and Van Aken et al. (2022) on a shared dataset, using metrics such as faithfulness (Comp and Suff, as defined in Section 5.1) and simulatability (as measured in Section 5.2). We will also include a discussion of the limitations of these metrics.\n\n*   **Dataset Licensing and Usage Restrictions:** The reviewer raises ethical concerns regarding dataset licensing. We acknowledge this omission. In the next version, we will explicitly state the dataset licenses and any usage restrictions in the Acknowledgements section, as well as in the dataset descriptions within the experimental sections.\n\n*   **Figure 7, Tables 1, 2, and Figure 8: Lack of Clarity:** The reviewer points out the lack of clear axis labels, units, and a legend in Figure 7, and the absence of confidence intervals or p-values in the tables. We agree with this assessment. We will revise Figure 7 to include clear axis labels, units, and a legend. We will also add confidence intervals to Tables 1 and 2, and include p-values where appropriate to indicate statistical significance in the next version.\n\n*   **Misuse Cases, Fairness, and Societal Impacts:** The reviewer highlights the lack of discussion on potential misuse cases, fairness, and broader societal impacts. We acknowledge this is a critical omission. We will add a new section to the paper (likely in the Ethics Statement) that addresses these aspects, including potential biases, fairness considerations, and strategies for mitigating misuse.\n\n*   **Notation in Section 2.1 and Definition of Faithfulness:** The reviewer suggests improving the notation in Section 2.1 and clarifying the definition of faithfulness. We believe the notation in Section 2.1 is already clear, but we will add a table of notation in the Appendix for easier reference, as suggested. The definition of faithfulness is explicitly provided in Section 1 and further elaborated in Section 5.1, where we cite DeYoung et al. (2019) and define the metrics Comp and Suff. We will clarify this further in the revised version.\n\n*   **Comparison with Sun et al. (2019):** The reviewer suggests comparing our performance against the hierarchical attention prototypical networks described in Sun et al. (2019). We will add a comparison to Sun et al. (2019) in the Related Works section, and we will conduct experiments on a few-shot text classification task, as suggested, to directly compare our method with the hierarchical attention prototypical networks.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Comparative Analysis with Das et al. (2022) and Van Aken et al. (2022):** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Explicit License and Consent Statements:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Improve Figure 7 and Tables:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Table of Notation:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Section on Misuse Cases, Fairness, and Societal Impacts:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Ablation Study with and without Token-Level Attention and Comparison with Sun et al. (2019):** We will conduct an ablation study comparing the performance of the proposed method with and without the token-level attention mechanism. We will also compare with the method in Sun et al. (2019) on a few-shot text classification task, as suggested."
