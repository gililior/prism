  "summary": "This paper investigates the impact of translationese on cross-lingual summarization (CLS) model evaluation and performance, a relevant problem given the reliance on translated data in this field. The paper provides concrete suggestions for future dataset and model developments based on the findings. The paper has been updated to address several weaknesses, including the reporting of variance, statistical significance, and a more precise definition of translationese. The authors have also clarified existing content regarding the CLS models used and human evaluation metrics.",
