    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the effort taken to thoroughly review our paper and provide constructive criticism. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Weakness 1: Delta between FACTSCORE and Manakul et al. (2023):** We respectfully disagree that the delta is unclear. Section 2, particularly the paragraph starting \"In contrast, our work (1)\" explicitly states the differences. We compare our work to Manakul et al. (2023) by considering much longer text generation, providing fine-grained evaluation by both human experts and an automated evaluator, and applying it to a large set of LMs at scale. We also use their method as a baseline estimator in Section 4. We will add a sentence to Section 2 to further clarify this comparison, including a brief quantitative comparison of performance on a shared dataset, if possible.\n\n*   **Weakness 2: Limitations of automated FACTSCORE:** We partially address this in Section 4.2 and 5. We acknowledge the limitations of our estimator, including its dependence on the quality of retrieval and the potential for bias. We will expand the discussion in Section 5 to explicitly address potential failure cases and biases, such as those related to the knowledge source (Wikipedia) and the LMEVAL.\n\n*   **Weakness 3: Figure 2 axis labels:** The reviewer is correct; the axes in Figure 2 lack explicit labels. We will add clear labels and units to the axes in Figure 2 in the revised version to improve clarity.\n\n*   **Weakness 4: Table 1 lacks confidence intervals:** We acknowledge this omission. We will include standard deviations and/or confidence intervals in Table 1 to provide a more complete picture of the results' reliability. We will also add p-values to indicate statistical significance of performance differences.\n\n*   **Weakness 5: Dataset license and usage restrictions:** We will add explicit license and consent statements for datasets used in the revised version.\n\n*   **Weakness 6: Definition of 'atomic fact':** We believe the definition is clear, but we will provide more examples in the Introduction and Figure 1 to clarify the scope and how it is determined. Table 7 provides examples of atomic facts.\n\n*   **Weakness 7: Lack of notation section:** We acknowledge this and will include a notation table defining key terms and symbols used throughout the paper.\n\n*   **Weaknesses 8-10: Bias, fairness, and societal impact:** We acknowledge these important considerations. We will add a section on potential misuse, discuss fairness implications, and add a Broader Impact section to address these concerns.\n\n*   **Weaknesses 11-12: Comparison with Lee et al. (2022) and Hoffmann et al. (2022):** We will add a discussion of how FACTSCORE relates to the factuality-enhanced language models proposed by Lee et al. (2022) and other automated factuality evaluation methods, such as those used in Hoffmann et al. (2022) in the Related Work section.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Suggestion 1: Detailed comparison with Manakul et al. (2023):** Addressed above in Weakness 1.\n\n*   **Suggestion 2: Analyze FACTSCORE on different claim types and knowledge sources:** This is a good suggestion, and we will expand our discussion of limitations in Section 5 to include this.\n\n*   **Suggestion 3: Dataset details:** We will provide more details on the datasets used for evaluation, including their size and composition, in Section 3.4.\n\n*   **Suggestion 4: Error bars in Figure 2:** We will add error bars to Figure 2 to show confidence intervals.\n\n*   **Suggestion 5: Confidence intervals and p-values in Table 1:** Addressed above in Weakness 4.\n\n*   **Suggestion 6: Dataset licenses:** Addressed above in Weakness 5.\n\n*   **Suggestion 7: More examples of atomic facts:** Addressed above in Weakness 6.\n\n*   **Suggestion 8: Notation table:** Addressed above in Weakness 7.\n\n*   **Suggestion 9: Potential misuse:** Addressed above in Weakness 8-10.\n\n*   **Suggestion 10: Fairness implications:** Addressed above in Weakness 8-10.\n\n*   **Suggestion 11: Broader Impact section:** Addressed above in Weakness 8-10.\n\n*   **Suggestion 12-13: Head-to-head comparison:** Addressed above in Weakness 11-12.\n\nWe believe that addressing these points will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our paper. We are grateful for the reviewer's guidance and look forward to incorporating their feedback in the revised version."
