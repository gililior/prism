  "summary": "This paper introduces FACTSCORE, a novel metric for evaluating the factual accuracy of long-form text generated by language models. The study provides both human and automated evaluations, offering insights into the factuality of various models, but the paper needs to address limitations and provide more rigorous comparisons to existing methods.",
