  "summary": "This paper introduces SCAR, a novel benchmark for evaluating LLMs' analogical reasoning abilities, moving beyond word analogies to system analogies. While the SCAR benchmark is a valuable contribution, the paper lacks crucial details regarding experimental setup, statistical analysis, and a thorough comparison with existing methods.",
