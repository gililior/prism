  "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their insightful and detailed feedback, which has helped us identify areas for improvement in our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of LLM version details and seeds:** The reviewer points out the lack of specific LLM versions and generation seeds, hindering reproducibility. We acknowledge this is a valid concern. While we specified the LLMs used (e.g., GPT-4, ChatGPT, InstructGPT series) in Section 4.2, we did not explicitly state the exact model versions or the seeds used for generation. We will rectify this in the next version by including the precise model versions (e.g., GPT-4-0613) and, where applicable, the random seeds used for generation to enhance reproducibility. We will also include a variance analysis, such as standard deviations, where appropriate, as suggested.\n\n*   **Insufficient comparison with existing methods:** The reviewer notes the lack of detailed comparisons with existing analogical reasoning methods. We respectfully disagree. Our paper *does* compare with existing methods, particularly in the Related Work section (Section 5). We discuss how our work differs from previous approaches, focusing on word analogies and analogies within the same domain. We highlight the novelty of our approach, which focuses on cross-domain system analogies and structure abduction. We will clarify this further by explicitly stating the limitations of existing methods in the Introduction and emphasizing the unique contributions of our work more strongly.\n\n*   **Imprecise definition of 'analogical structure abduction' and lack of notation:** The reviewer finds the definition of 'analogical structure abduction' imprecise. We believe the definition is provided in the Abstract, Introduction (Section 1), and Section 3.4, where we formally define the task. We will enhance clarity by providing a more concise definition early in the Introduction and adding a dedicated section or table defining the symbols and terms used, as suggested, to avoid any ambiguity.\n\n*   **Lack of statistical information:** The reviewer points out the lack of statistical information (standard deviations, confidence intervals, p-values). We acknowledge this and will incorporate standard deviations or confidence intervals for all reported accuracy results in Tables 2 and 5, and add p-values where appropriate. We will also add error bars to Figures 3 and 4 to improve clarity.\n\n*   **Unclear labels and legends in Figures 3 and 4:** The reviewer notes the lack of clear labels and legends in Figures 3 and 4. We will address this by adding clear labels and comprehensive legends to all figures to improve readability and interpretation.\n\n*   **Lack of discussion on biases, malicious use, and societal impacts:** The reviewer correctly points out the absence of a discussion on potential biases, malicious use, and broader societal impacts. We will include a new section in the revised manuscript addressing these important ethical considerations, including potential biases in the data, the possibility of misuse, and the broader societal implications of our work.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Provide exact LLM versions, parameters, and seeds:** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Head-to-head comparison with a state-of-the-art method and baseline experiment:** We will consider adding a baseline experiment using the E-KAR benchmark methods on the SCAR dataset in the next version, but we believe that the focus of our paper is on a different type of analogy (system analogy) than the E-KAR benchmark (word analogy). We will clarify this point in the revised manuscript.\n\n*   **Clear definition of 'analogical structure abduction' and notation:** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Add error bars and statistical information:** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Include a section on biases, malicious use, and societal impacts:** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Evaluate LLMs on SCAR using Chain of Thought prompting:** We have already evaluated the performance of LLMs on the SCAR benchmark using Chain of Thought prompting. The results are presented in Section 4.3 and Figure 3. We will ensure this is clearer in the revised manuscript.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
