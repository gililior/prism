    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their insightful and constructive feedback. We have carefully considered each point and provide detailed responses below.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Weakness 1: Insufficient detail on prompting strategies, aggregation methods, and tailored CoT.**\n    *   **Response:** We believe the paper provides sufficient detail, but we acknowledge the reviewer's concern about reproducibility. We provide detailed descriptions of the prompting methods (REW, RTR, RAR) in Section 3.2, including how the prompts are constructed. The aggregation methods (MaxProb, SC, Mean) are described in Section 3.3, with equations for each method. The tailored CoT is described in Section 3.2.4, and an example is provided in Table 4 and Appendix B.1. We will make our code publicly available to further enhance reproducibility, as mentioned in the paper. We will also add a more detailed pseudocode description of the prompting and aggregation methods in the appendix to further clarify the process.\n\n*   **Weakness 2: Lack of discussion on potential risks and societal implications of LLMs.**\n    *   **Response:** We acknowledge this is a valid concern. While our focus is on the technical aspects of LLM application to conversational search, we agree that a discussion of broader impacts is crucial. We will add a \"Broader Impact\" section to the conclusion of the revised paper. This section will address potential biases in LLMs, the risk of generating misleading information, and ethical considerations related to the use of LLMs in search.\n\n*   **Weakness 3: Lack of clear axis labels and component definitions in Figures 3 and 4.**\n    *   **Response:** We agree with the reviewer. We will revise Figure 3 to include clear axis labels and specify the categories on the x-axis. We will also add more detailed labels to the different parts of the prompt in Figure 4 to improve clarity.\n\n*   **Weakness 4: Lack of clarity on the delta between LLM4CS and existing methods.**\n    *   **Response:** We believe the introduction and related work sections clearly differentiate LLM4CS. We highlight the novelty of our prompting framework and the use of hypothetical responses in the introduction. Section 2 provides a comprehensive overview of existing CQR and CDR methods. We will revise the introduction to explicitly state the key differences: (1) the use of LLMs for both rewriting and response generation, (2) the novel prompting methods (REW, RTR, RAR), and (3) the aggregation strategies.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Suggestion 1: Conduct a detailed ablation study.**\n    *   **Response:** We have already conducted an ablation study, and the results are presented in Section 4.5 and 4.6. Table 3 provides a detailed comparison of different prompting and aggregation methods. Figure 2 shows the impact of incorporating CoT. We believe these results sufficiently address the suggestion.\n\n*   **Suggestion 2: Provide more details on the specific prompting methods, aggregation methods, and tailored CoT.**\n    *   **Response:** We believe we have addressed this in our response to Weakness 1. We will add a more detailed pseudocode description of the prompting and aggregation methods in the appendix to further clarify the process.\n\n*   **Suggestion 3: Add axis labels and specify the categories on the x-axis for Figure 3. Clearly label the different parts of the prompt in Figure 4.**\n    *   **Response:** We agree and will implement this suggestion as part of our revisions.\n\n*   **Suggestion 4: Include a Broader Impact section.**\n    *   **Response:** We agree and will implement this suggestion as part of our revisions.\n\n*   **Suggestion 5: Conduct experiments comparing LLM4CS with a conversational query rewriting method from [1] and a baseline using a standard text-to-text transformer (e.g., T5) for query rewriting.**\n    *   **Response:** We respectfully disagree with this suggestion. We already compare our method with T5QR (Lin et al., 2020), which is a T5-based conversational query rewriter, as described in Section 4.3. We believe that including additional baselines would not significantly change the conclusions of the paper and would increase the computational cost. We believe the current baselines provide a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
