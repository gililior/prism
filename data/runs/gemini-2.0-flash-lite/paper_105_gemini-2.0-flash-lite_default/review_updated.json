  "summary": "This paper introduces LLM4CS, a novel framework leveraging Large Language Models for conversational search, demonstrating improved performance in conveying user intent compared to existing methods. The paper addresses some weaknesses raised in the initial review, including clarifying prompting strategies and aggregation methods, and will add a Broader Impact section. However, the paper still needs to improve figure clarity.",
