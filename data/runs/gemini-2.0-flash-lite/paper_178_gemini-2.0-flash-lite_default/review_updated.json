  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel 'tree topological probe' for understanding pretrained language models. The paper presents a potentially interesting approach, but still suffers from weaknesses in clarity, experimental rigor, and a lack of comprehensive evaluation, particularly regarding generalizability and potential societal impacts. The authors have provided rebuttals that clarify some aspects of the work and promise future improvements.",
