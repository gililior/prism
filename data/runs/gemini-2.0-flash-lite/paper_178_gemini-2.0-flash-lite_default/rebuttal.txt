    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of Generalizability:** The reviewer questions the generalizability beyond BERT and RoBERTa. While we acknowledge the primary focus is on these models, we partially address this in Section 4 and Appendix F. We present results for RoBERTa-large in Appendix F, demonstrating consistent patterns. We will expand this in the next version by including experiments on a wider range of models, as suggested, to further substantiate our claims of generalizability. We will also add a discussion on the applicability of the method to other model architectures in the Discussion Section.\n\n*   **Lack of Mathematical Formalization:** The reviewer points out the lack of sufficient mathematical formalization (Sec 5). We acknowledge this limitation. We will revise Section 5 to provide a more rigorous mathematical formalization of the topological probe, potentially incorporating elements of category theory as suggested in the Conclusion.\n\n*   **Dataset Licensing and Usage Restrictions:** The reviewer notes the absence of dataset licensing information. We will add explicit license and consent statements for all datasets used in the next version, as suggested. This will be included in Appendix C, where we detail the data sources.\n\n*   **Unclear Figure Labels:** The reviewer criticizes the lack of clear axis labels in Figures 1, 2, and 3. We agree that this could hinder interpretation. We will revise these figures to include more descriptive axis labels, including units where applicable, to improve clarity.\n\n*   **Unclear Definition of 'Tree':** The reviewer requests a clearer definition of 'tree' in the context of the 'tree topological probe' (Abstract). The term 'tree' refers to the dependency tree structure of a sentence. We will clarify this in the Abstract and Introduction, explicitly mentioning dependency trees to avoid ambiguity.\n\n*   **Addressing Biases:** The reviewer raises concerns about potential biases in the data and model. We acknowledge this is a crucial point. We will add a discussion of potential biases and fairness considerations in the Conclusion, as suggested. We will also include a discussion of the limitations of the proposed method, including its sensitivity to hyperparameter settings, in the Discussion Section.\n\n*   **Potential for Misuse:** The reviewer highlights the potential for misuse. We will add a section in the Conclusion to address potential misuse cases, such as manipulating model behavior or deceiving users.\n\n*   **Broader Societal Impacts:** The reviewer requests a discussion of broader societal impacts. We will add a Broader Impact section to the Conclusion to discuss the societal implications of the work, including both positive and negative impacts.\n\n*   **Failure Modes and Limitations:** The reviewer points out the lack of discussion on potential failure modes and limitations. We will add a section discussing the limitations of the 'tree topological probe', including its computational complexity and sensitivity to hyperparameter settings, in the Discussion Section.\n\n*   **Comparison with Existing Probing Methods:** The reviewer suggests comparing our method with existing probing methods. While we discuss related work in Section 2, we will conduct an experiment comparing the performance of the 'tree topological probe' against a standard probing method on a benchmark task. This will be added to the Experimental Setup section.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Wider Range of Models:** We will conduct experiments on a wider range of models, as discussed above.\n\n*   **Mathematical Formalization:** We will provide a more rigorous mathematical formalization, as discussed above.\n\n*   **Dataset Licensing:** We will add explicit license and consent statements, as discussed above.\n\n*   **Descriptive Axis Labels:** We will provide more descriptive axis labels, as discussed above.\n\n*   **Standard Deviations/Confidence Intervals/P-values:** We will include standard deviations and/or confidence intervals for all reported values and add p-values to compare the performance of different methods or groups in Tables 1-5. This will provide a more robust statistical analysis of our results.\n\n*   **Discussion of Risks, Misuse, and Fairness:** We will add a detailed discussion of potential risks, misuse cases, and fairness considerations in the Conclusion, as discussed above.\n\n*   **Broader Impact Section:** We will add a Broader Impact section to the Conclusion, as discussed above.\n\n*   **Comparison Experiment:** We will conduct an experiment comparing our method to a standard probing method, as discussed above.\n\n*   **Limitations Discussion:** We will add a section discussing the limitations of the 'tree topological probe', as discussed above.\n\nWe believe these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our work. Thank you again for the valuable feedback."
