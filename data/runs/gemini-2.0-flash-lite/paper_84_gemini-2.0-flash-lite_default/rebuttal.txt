    "rebuttal": "We thank the reviewer for their thorough and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time taken to carefully review our manuscript and provide constructive criticism. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of Empirical Evidence:** The reviewer notes the absence of empirical evidence to support our claims. We acknowledge that this is a position paper, and as such, it primarily presents a normative argument based on existing research. We explicitly state this in the Introduction: \"In this position paper, we make a normative argument against gratuitous anthropomorphic features, grounded in findings from psychology, linguistics, and human-computer interaction...\" (Section 1). While we do not present new empirical results, we draw on a wide range of existing studies from psychology, linguistics, and HCI to support our arguments. We believe that the synthesis of these findings provides a valuable contribution by highlighting the potential harms of anthropomorphism and offering recommendations for safer dialogue system design.\n\n*   **Definition of Anthropomorphism and Methodology:** The reviewer suggests that the definition of anthropomorphism could be more precise and that the methodology for identifying linguistic factors is unclear. We respectfully disagree. Section 2 provides a clear definition of anthropomorphism: \"Anthropomorphism refers to attributing human characteristics or behaviour to non-human entities, e.g. animals or objects.\" We further clarify that anthropomorphism exists on a spectrum and discuss both human and agent factors that contribute to it. The methodology for identifying linguistic factors is described in Section 3, where we outline various linguistic features (voice, content, register, style, and roles) that can engender personification. We provide specific examples within each subsection, drawing on prior research to illustrate how these factors contribute to anthropomorphism. We believe that the structure of Section 3, with its detailed subsections and examples, provides a clear and organized analysis of the linguistic factors.\n\n*   **Figure 1 Description:** The reviewer points out the lack of description for the figure's axes and legends. We acknowledge this oversight. Figure 1 is intended to provide a visual example of a dialogue system response and a de-anthropomorphized version. We will revise the figure caption to include a more detailed explanation of the visualization and its components, including labels for the axes and a legend, in the next version of the paper.\n\n*   **Ethical Concerns:** The reviewer raises concerns about the lack of discussion on ethical considerations. We acknowledge this as a valid point. While we address some ethical implications in Section 4 (Consequences of Anthropomorphism), we will expand the Ethical Considerations section to include a more comprehensive discussion of data privacy, consent, usage terms, potential biases, misuse scenarios, and specific failure modes. This will strengthen the paper's contribution to responsible AI development.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Experiments on Anthropomorphic Features:** The reviewer suggests conducting experiments to quantify the impact of anthropomorphic features. While this is a valuable suggestion, it is beyond the scope of this position paper. Our goal is to synthesize existing research and provide recommendations. However, we acknowledge the importance of empirical validation and will consider this suggestion for future research directions.\n\n*   **Cultural and Linguistic Differences:** The reviewer suggests investigating how cultural and linguistic differences affect the perception of anthropomorphism. This is an important consideration, and we touch upon it in the Conclusion, where we state: \"...it should be noted that other languages have features such as grammatical ways of denoting animacy... and gender that could influence users personification of systems...\" (Section 6). We will expand on this point in the Conclusion to emphasize the need for future research to consider these differences.\n\n*   **Dedicated Ethical Section:** We agree with the suggestion to include a dedicated section on ethical implications. As mentioned above, we will expand the Ethical Considerations section to address the reviewer's concerns.\n\n*   **Figure 1 Clarification:** We will revise the figure caption to include labels for the axes and a legend, as suggested.\n\n*   **Detailed Explanation of Linguistic Factors:** We believe that Section 3 already provides a detailed explanation of the linguistic factors contributing to anthropomorphism, with specific examples. However, we will review this section to ensure clarity and provide additional examples where necessary.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the paper and address the reviewer's concerns. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
