  "summary": "This position paper identifies the problem of anthropomorphism in dialogue systems and its potential harms, offering a good overview of the topic. The authors have addressed some of the initial concerns regarding clarity and ethical considerations, but the lack of empirical evidence remains a significant weakness. The authors will revise the figure and expand the ethical considerations section.",
