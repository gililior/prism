    "rebuttal": "We thank the reviewer for their thorough and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time taken to carefully review our work and provide constructive criticism. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Reproducibility:** The reviewer notes a lack of crucial details for reproducibility, including seeds, variance, and model architecture. We believe the paper already provides substantial information on these aspects. Specifically, the model architecture and training details are described in Section 5.2 and Appendix C. We also provide details on the train/dev/test splits in Section C. We will add a sentence to Appendix C clarifying that we used a fixed random seed for all experiments. We will also include a sentence in the same section mentioning that we ran each experiment three times and report the average results. We believe the reviewer may have overlooked these sections.\n\n*   **Generalizability and Comparison to Existing Work:** The reviewer suggests the paper overclaims generalizability and lacks detailed comparisons. We respectfully disagree. Section 2, \"Related Work,\" provides a comprehensive overview of existing work on document similarity and related areas, including those that consider emotional aspects. We acknowledge that our work is novel in its focus on empathic similarity. We will add a sentence to the conclusion emphasizing the novelty of our approach. We also believe the reviewer may have overlooked the extensive discussion of related work in Section 2.\n\n*   **Statistical Information and Figure Clarity:** The reviewer points out the lack of statistical information (SD, CI, p-values) and unclear figure labels. We acknowledge this is a valid concern. We will add standard deviations and confidence intervals to Tables 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10. We will also add p-values to Table 4 to indicate the statistical significance of performance differences. We will add axis labels and units to Figures 3 and 4. We will update the paper accordingly.\n\n*   **Bias and Misuse:** The reviewer raises concerns about dataset bias and potential misuse. We address these concerns in the Ethics Statement section. We will expand this section to include a more detailed discussion of potential misuse cases, including the creation of echo chambers and manipulation of emotions. We will also add a sentence to the conclusion reiterating the importance of addressing bias and misuse.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Code, Data, and Experimental Setup:** The reviewer suggests providing code, data, and a detailed experimental setup. We plan to release the code and data upon publication. We will add a sentence to the paper stating this intention. The experimental setup is already detailed in Section 5 and Appendix C.\n\n*   **Ablation Studies:** The reviewer suggests ablation studies. Given the scope of the paper, we believe that the current analysis of the features (main event, emotion, and moral) in Section 3.2 and Appendix A provides sufficient insight into the contribution of each feature. We will consider ablation studies for future work.\n\n*   **Model Architecture and Hyperparameters:** The reviewer suggests more details on model architecture and hyperparameters. These details are already provided in Section 5.2 and Appendix C. We will add a sentence to Section 5.2 cross-referencing Appendix C.\n\n*   **Statistical Information and Figure Clarity:** We will address this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Bias and Misuse:** We will address this suggestion as described above.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity and impact of our work. We are grateful for the reviewer's feedback and look forward to the opportunity to further refine our paper."
