  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel task of empathic similarity and presents a new dataset, EMPATHICSTORIES, along with a model fine-tuned on this dataset. The user study provides compelling evidence of the model's ability to improve empathy compared to a semantic similarity baseline. However, the paper lacks crucial details for reproducibility and needs to address potential biases and limitations.",
