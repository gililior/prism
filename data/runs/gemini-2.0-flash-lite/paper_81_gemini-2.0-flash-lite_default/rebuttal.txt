    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of dataset licensing and usage restrictions:** The reviewer is correct; we did not explicitly state dataset licensing. We will add a sentence in Section 4.1, Datasets and Baselines, to clarify that we use publicly available datasets and adhere to their respective licenses. We will also include a link to the dataset licenses in the appendix.\n\n*   **Claims of simplicity and effectiveness not fully supported:** We respectfully disagree. We believe the experimental results in Table 1 and the ablation studies in Section 4.3 demonstrate the effectiveness of FLatS. We will clarify the definition of 'simplicity' in Section 8, Conclusion, by stating that FLatS is simple to implement, as it builds upon existing OOD scores. We will also add a sentence in Section 5, Results and Analysis, to quantify the performance improvement of FLatS over the baselines.\n\n*   **Overstated generalizability:** We acknowledge that our experiments primarily focus on post-hoc methods. However, the core concept of FLatS, incorporating OOD density estimation via likelihood ratio, is general. We will modify the wording in Section 8 to reflect this nuance, emphasizing the potential for broader applicability while acknowledging the current scope.\n\n*   **Figures 2 and 3 lack axis labels and units:** The reviewer is correct. We will add clear axis labels (e.g., 'Baseline Method', 'Average FPR@95 (%)') and units to Figures 2 and 3 in the revised version to improve clarity.\n\n*   **Details on differences from Ren et al. (2019) and Xiao et al. (2020):** We address this in Section 6, Related Work. We will expand this section to provide a more direct comparison, highlighting the key differences in the likelihood ratio formulation and the use of P_out and P_in in FLatS.\n\n*   **Unclear definition of 'OOD-ness':** The term 'OOD-ness' is used throughout the paper to refer to the degree to which a sample deviates from the in-distribution. We define OOD detection in Section 2, Background, and the OOD score S(x) is defined to measure the OOD-ness of x. We will add a sentence in the Abstract and Section 1 to explicitly link 'OOD-ness' to the likelihood ratio and the goal of distinguishing between P_in and P_out.\n\n*   **Notation in equations (1) and (2):** We will explicitly define all symbols used in Equations (1) and (2) in Section 2 to improve clarity.\n\n*   **Table 1 lacks standard deviations:** We will include standard deviations and confidence intervals in Table 1 to quantify the variability of the results.\n\n*   **Lack of discussion on misuse scenarios, ethical implications, and biases:** We acknowledge this omission. We will add a new section in the appendix to discuss potential misuse cases, ethical implications, and potential biases in the datasets used. We will also discuss mitigation strategies.\n\n*   **Lack of discussion of broader societal impacts:** We will add a paragraph to the new appendix section to discuss the broader societal impacts, including potential benefits and risks, and consider the impact on different user groups.\n\n*   **Lack of discussion of potential failure modes:** We will add a paragraph to the new appendix section to detail the limitations of the proposed method and potential failure modes.\n\n*   **No comparison with [1] or methods leveraging auxiliary OOD data:** We will add a comparison with the method in [1] and methods that leverage auxiliary OOD data in the revised version.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Add explicit license and consent statements:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **More detailed experimental results:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Experiments with different OOD datasets:** We will conduct experiments with different OOD datasets to demonstrate its generalizability.\n\n*   **Add a legend and error bars to Figures 2 and 3:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Direct comparison with Ren et al. (2019) and Xiao et al. (2020):** Addressed above.\n\n*   **More detailed explanation of likelihood ratio:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Define all symbols in equations (1) and (2):** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Include standard deviations or confidence intervals:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Include a section on potential misuse cases:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Analyze the datasets used for potential biases:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Expand the discussion of broader societal impacts:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Add a section detailing the limitations:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Include a discussion on the ethical implications:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Conduct an experiment comparing FLatS with the method in [1]:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Compare FLatS with methods that use auxiliary OOD data:** Addressed above.\n\nWe believe these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, completeness, and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
