  "summary": "This paper introduces FLatS, a novel framework for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, claiming state-of-the-art performance by leveraging likelihood ratios. The paper demonstrates promising results and a clear framework. The authors have addressed several methodological and ethical concerns raised in the initial review, including dataset licensing, clarity of figures, and comparisons to prior work. However, the paper still needs to provide more detailed experimental results and address the generalizability of the method.",
