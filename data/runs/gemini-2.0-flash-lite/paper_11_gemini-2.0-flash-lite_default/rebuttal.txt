    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our paper and providing constructive criticism. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Reproducibility (Lack of random seeds, variance, and software environment):** We acknowledge the importance of reproducibility. While we did specify the hyperparameters used in Section 6.1, we did not explicitly state the random seeds or report the variance. We will include the random seeds used for all experiments and report the standard deviation of the results across multiple runs in Tables 7, 8, and 9 in the revised version. We will also provide a link to our code repository and specify the software environment using a `requirements.txt` file to facilitate reproducibility (Section 6.1).\n\n*   **Overclaiming Yorùbá's performance:** We acknowledge that the explanation for Yorùbá's performance in zero-shot transfer to Tigrinya (Table 9) was speculative. We will conduct further analysis, potentially including feature analysis or comparison with other languages, to provide a more robust explanation in the revised version.\n\n*   **Limited use of scaling for XLM-R-large:** We respectfully disagree that we did not provide sufficient evidence. In Section 6.2, we state that \"scaling is of limited use for XLM-R-large as it has not been pre-trained on many African languages.\" This is because XLM-R-large, unlike AfroXLMR-large, was not specifically pre-trained on a significant number of African languages. We will clarify this point further in the revised version.\n\n*   **Figure 3 axis labels:** The reviewer is correct; Figure 3 lacks axis labels. We will add clear axis labels (e.g., \"Number of Tweets\" and \"Sentiment Label\") and units to Figure 3 in the revised version. We will also consider using a bar chart for improved readability.\n\n*   **Dataset license and usage restrictions:** We will add explicit license and consent statements for datasets used in the Appendix D of the revised version.\n\n*   **Lack of statistical significance (standard deviations, confidence intervals, p-values):** We agree that including statistical significance measures would strengthen our results. We will include standard deviations or confidence intervals in Tables 7, 8, and 9 to indicate the variability of the results. We will also add p-values to compare the performance of different models in Tables 7 and 8 in the revised version.\n\n*   **Definition of \"low-resource\":** The reviewer is correct that we did not explicitly define \"low-resource.\" We will add a specific metric or reference to define \"low-resource\" in the Introduction (Section 1) in the revised version.\n\n*   **Figure 1 caption:** We will provide a more descriptive caption for Figure 1, clarifying that it visualizes the countries and languages represented in AfriSenti in the revised version.\n\n*   **Comparison to state-of-the-art:** We respectfully disagree. The paper already compares its performance against state-of-the-art methods. In Section 6.2, we compare the performance of AfriSenti against several PLMs, including AfriBERTa and AfroXLMR, which are mentioned in the Related Work. We will clarify this point further in the revised version.\n\n*   **Detailed analysis of performance differences:** We acknowledge the value of a more detailed analysis. While Section 6.2 discusses the performance of different models across languages, we will expand this analysis in the revised version to highlight challenges and opportunities for future research.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   We will incorporate the suggestions regarding random seeds, variance, software environment, Yorùbá analysis, Figure 3, dataset licenses, and statistical significance as detailed above.\n\n*   We will add a Broader Impact section in the Conclusion, including mitigation strategies.\n\n*   We will evaluate the performance of AfriSenti using different PLMs to establish a strong baseline and identify the most suitable models for African languages (Sec 4). We will also add a table summarizing the key notations used throughout the paper.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
