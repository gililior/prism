  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel self-verification method to mitigate error accumulation in Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting for LLMs. The method's novelty lies in its self-verification approach. The authors have addressed some of the initial concerns regarding experimental setup, statistical analysis, and comprehensive comparisons with existing methods in their rebuttal, but further improvements are still needed.",
