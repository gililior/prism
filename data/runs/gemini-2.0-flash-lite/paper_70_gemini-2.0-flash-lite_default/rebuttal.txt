    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our paper. We address each concern below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Experimental Setup Details & Reproducibility:** The reviewer points out a lack of crucial experimental details. We believe that the paper already addresses this to a large extent. Section 4.2 details the models used (GPT-3 code-davinci-001 and Instruct-GPT code-davinci-002). Section 4.1 and Appendix A.2 provide details on the datasets, including their characteristics. Section 4.4 describes the implementation, including the number of candidate answers (K=5) and the number of backward verification iterations (P=10). Appendix A.3 provides a reproducibility statement, including the OpenAI API usage dates. We believe the reviewer may have overlooked these sections. However, we acknowledge that we can improve reproducibility further. In the next version, we will include the specific versions of the OpenAI API library used, the hardware used for running the experiments, and the random seeds. We will also provide a link to a public code repository. We will also report the variance of the results in all tables.\n\n*   **Statistical Significance & Baseline Comparison:** The reviewer requests more statistical analysis and a stronger baseline comparison. We partially address this. Table 1 provides a comparison with several baselines, including fine-tuned GPT-3 and a verifier model (Cobbe et al., 2021). We will include a head-to-head comparison with a strong baseline that also addresses error correction in CoT. We will also perform t-tests to assess the statistical significance of the performance differences and include p-values in Table 1.\n\n*   **Prompting Strategy & Backward Verification Details:** The reviewer requests more detail on the prompting strategy. We believe that the paper provides sufficient detail. Section 3.2.1 and Appendix A.6 describe the prompts used for backward verification. Section 4.3 states that we used the same CoT prompts as Wei et al. (2022) for forward reasoning. We will clarify the prompting strategy further in the next version, potentially including a more detailed breakdown of the prompts used.\n\n*   **Figure Clarity:** The reviewer notes the lack of clear axis labels, units, and legends in several figures. We acknowledge this and will revise Figures 3, 5, 6, and 7 to include these elements for improved clarity.\n\n*   **Ethical Considerations:** The reviewer raises important ethical considerations. We acknowledge the omission of this section and will add a new section discussing dataset consent, privacy, usage terms for LLMs, potential risks, fairness, and broader societal impacts. We will also include concrete mitigation strategies.\n\n*   **Definitions & Notation:** The reviewer requests clear definitions for \"Forward Reasoning\" and \"Backward Verification\" and an explanation of the \"GLYPH\" notations. We introduce these terms in Section 3. We will provide more formal definitions and, if possible, mathematical formulations for these terms. The \"GLYPH\" notations are a result of the PDF rendering and are not part of our method. We will replace them with more readable text in the next version.\n\n*   **Societal Impacts:** The reviewer requests a comprehensive discussion of broader societal impacts. We acknowledge the omission of this section and will add a Broader Impact section discussing the potential societal implications of the research, both positive and negative.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Detailed Experimental Setup:** We will incorporate the suggested improvements to the experimental setup, including library versions, hardware details, random seeds, and variance reporting, as detailed above.\n\n*   **Dataset Description:** We believe that the dataset descriptions in Section 4.1 and Appendix A.2 are sufficient, but we will expand on these descriptions in the next version.\n\n*   **Statistical Analysis & Baseline Comparison:** We will incorporate the suggested statistical analysis and head-to-head baseline comparison as detailed above.\n\n*   **Definitions & Notation:** We will incorporate the suggested improvements to the definitions and notation as detailed above.\n\n*   **Table Enhancements:** We will add standard deviations or confidence intervals and p-values to all tables as detailed above.\n\n*   **Ethical Discussion:** We will incorporate the suggested ethical discussion as detailed above.\n\n*   **Broader Impact Section:** We will incorporate the suggested Broader Impact section as detailed above.\n\n*   **Comparison with CoT and Self-Consistency:** We will conduct experiments comparing our self-verification method with CoT prompting (Wei et al., 2022) and self-consistency decoding (Wang et al., 2023c) on a set of reasoning tasks.\n\n*   **Ablation Study:** We will conduct an ablation study to isolate the impact of the self-verification component.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our paper. We are grateful for the reviewer's guidance and look forward to incorporating their feedback.\n"
