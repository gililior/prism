    "rebuttal": "We thank the reviewer for their thorough and insightful feedback. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Weakness 1:** \"The paper claims Prefix Global attention outperforms full attention, but the specific performance gains and the extent of the improvement are not clearly quantified.\" (Sec 5) We respectfully disagree. Section 5.1, particularly Figure 4, directly quantifies the performance gains of Prefix Global over full attention across different sequence lengths for all three tasks. The ROUGE-L scores are clearly plotted, demonstrating the performance differences. We will add a sentence to Section 5.1 to explicitly state the average performance gains across all tasks and sequence lengths.\n\n*   **Weakness 2:** \"The novelty of the Prefix Global attention mechanism needs to be more clearly articulated, especially in relation to existing local-global attention mechanisms.\" (Sec 1) We believe the novelty is sufficiently articulated. Section 3 provides a detailed explanation of Prefix Global, contrasting it with TGlobal (Guo et al., 2022), a prominent local-global attention mechanism. Figure 2 visually illustrates the differences. We will add a sentence to the introduction to explicitly highlight the key differences in the attention mechanism.\n\n*   **Weakness 3:** \"The paper lacks a clear definition of 'Prefix Global' attention mechanism. The explanation is brief and lacks mathematical formulation.\" (Abstract, Introduction) The explanation is present in Section 3, but we acknowledge the lack of a mathematical formulation. We will add a mathematical formulation of Prefix Global in Section 3 to clarify the mechanism further.\n\n*   **Weakness 4:** \"The paper does not mention the use of seeds for the experiments, making it impossible to assess the variance and reproducibility of the results. Only a single run is reported.\" (Section 4) The reviewer is correct. We did not explicitly state the use of seeds. We will add a sentence to Section 4 stating that we used random seeds for all experiments and will report the variance across multiple runs in the next version.\n\n*   **Weakness 5:** \"The paper does not provide information about the software environment used for the experiments, such as the versions of the libraries and the operating system.\" (Section 4) We will include a `requirements.txt` file in the supplementary material to specify the software environment.\n\n*   **Weakness 6:** \"Figure 4 lacks clear axis labels and units, making it difficult to interpret the results quantitatively. Figure 3's color scheme could be improved for better clarity.\" (Fig 3, Fig 4) We will add axis labels and units to Figure 4 and improve the color scheme of Figure 3.\n\n*   **Weakness 7:** \"Many tables lack standard deviations, confidence intervals, or p-values to support claims of performance differences. Some tables lack clear headers or units.\" (Tables 1, 3, 5, 6, 7) We will add standard deviations and/or confidence intervals to Tables 5, 6, and 7. We will also ensure all tables have clear headers and units.\n\n*   **Weakness 8:** \"The paper does not address potential biases in the dataset or model outputs, nor does it discuss the potential for misuse or generation of harmful content.\" (Insufficient evidence) We acknowledge this omission. We will add a new section to the paper discussing potential biases in the dataset (e.g., Wikipedia's inherent biases) and model outputs, along with mitigation strategies. We will also address the potential for misuse and generation of harmful content and how we will mitigate these risks.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Suggestion 1:** \"Provide a detailed comparison of Prefix Global attention with other attention mechanisms, including quantitative results and statistical significance.\" (Sec 5) We believe this is already addressed in Section 5.1, where we compare Prefix Global with TGlobal and full attention. We will add statistical significance tests to the comparison.\n\n*   **Suggestion 2:** \"Conduct a more extensive ablation study to isolate the impact of Prefix Global attention, including comparisons with other global attention mechanisms.\" (Sec 4) We have already conducted extensive ablations, as detailed in Section 4 and Appendix D. We will consider adding comparisons with other global attention mechanisms in future work.\n\n*   **Suggestion 3:** \"Provide the code, data, and a script to reproduce the experiments. Include the random seeds used for all experiments. Report the variance across multiple runs.\" (Section 4) We will release the code, data, and a script to reproduce the experiments, including the random seeds and variance across multiple runs.\n\n*   **Suggestion 4:** \"Release a requirements.txt or a Dockerfile to specify the software environment.\" (Section 4) We will release a `requirements.txt` file.\n\n*   **Suggestion 5:** \"Provide a more detailed explanation of the Prefix Global attention mechanism, including a mathematical formulation and a diagram.\" (Methods) We will add a mathematical formulation of Prefix Global in Section 3.\n\n*   **Suggestion 6:** \"Include example inputs and outputs for each of the three tasks (page description generation, section summarization, and contextual image captioning).\" (Introduction, Figure 1) We already provide example inputs and outputs in Tables 15, 16, and 17, and Figure 3. We will consider adding more examples in the introduction.\n\n*   **Suggestion 7:** \"In Figure 4, label the axes clearly (e.g., 'Sequence Length' with units, 'ROUGE-L Score'). Use a more distinct color palette in Figure 3 to differentiate the components.\" (Fig 3, Fig 4) We will address this.\n\n*   **Suggestion 8:** \"Include standard deviations or confidence intervals for all reported metrics (BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, CIDEr) in Tables 5, 6, and 7. Add p-values to indicate statistical significance of performance differences between different configurations.\" (Tables 5, 6, 7) We will address this.\n\n*   **Suggestion 9:** \"Include a section on potential biases in the dataset and how they will be mitigated. Discuss the potential for the model to generate misleading or harmful content and how these risks will be mitigated. Discuss the potential for the dataset to be misused and how to prevent it.\" (Insufficient evidence) We will address this by adding a new section on potential biases and mitigation strategies."
