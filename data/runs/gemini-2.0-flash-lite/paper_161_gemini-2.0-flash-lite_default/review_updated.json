  "summary": "This paper introduces WikiWeb2M, a new multimodal dataset for webpage understanding, and proposes Prefix Global attention, a novel attention mechanism. The dataset and attention mechanism show promise. The authors have addressed some of the initial concerns regarding clarity, reproducibility, and evaluation. However, some weaknesses remain, particularly regarding the quantification of performance gains and the handling of potential biases.",
