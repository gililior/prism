  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel architecture for improving compositional scene understanding in VLMs by integrating scene graph information. The method demonstrates improved performance on fine-grained datasets. The paper has been updated to address concerns about experimental setup, architectural details, and comparisons to existing methods, but still needs further improvements.",
