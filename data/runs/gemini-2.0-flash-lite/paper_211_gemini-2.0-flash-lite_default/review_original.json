  "summary": "This paper introduces ProTeGi, a novel method for automatic prompt optimization using textual gradients, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing baselines. While the approach shows promise, the paper lacks sufficient detail in several areas, including experimental setup, statistical rigor, and ethical considerations, which limits the reproducibility and impact of the work.",
