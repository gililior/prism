  "summary": "This paper introduces ProTeGi, a novel method for automatic prompt optimization using textual gradients, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing baselines. The authors have addressed some of the initial concerns regarding clarity and reproducibility by clarifying existing content and promising future additions. However, the paper still lacks sufficient detail in several areas, including statistical rigor and ethical considerations, which limits the reproducibility and impact of the work.",
