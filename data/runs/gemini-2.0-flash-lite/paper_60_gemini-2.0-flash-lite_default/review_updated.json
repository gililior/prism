  "summary": "This paper investigates the internal mechanisms of factual knowledge retrieval in Transformers, proposing a three-step process for attribute extraction. The paper provides evidence for the role of lower layers and MLP/MHSA sublayers in this process, but lacks sufficient quantitative comparisons and clarity in several areas. The authors have clarified some points in their rebuttal, particularly regarding novelty and the definition of the 'enrichment process'.",
