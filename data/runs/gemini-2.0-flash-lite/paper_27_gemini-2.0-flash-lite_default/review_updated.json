  "summary": "This paper introduces LEAP, a novel system for multi-step logical reasoning that incorporates explicit planning into the inference procedure. The paper demonstrates competitive performance against GPT-3 and other methods on standard datasets, but could improve clarity in articulating performance gains and addressing potential limitations. The authors have addressed some concerns regarding clarity and reproducibility.",
