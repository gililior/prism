    "rebuttal": "We thank the reviewer for their insightful and thorough feedback. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of clarity on baselines and performance improvements; effectiveness of training strategy:** We believe the paper *does* clearly articulate the baselines and the magnitude of performance improvements. The abstract highlights that LEAP significantly outperforms competing methods on multiple datasets. Section 6.1 and Table 1 directly compare LEAP (System A and System B) with baselines like a T5 model, GPT-3, RuleTaker, and Neural Unification, providing AUROC and F1 scores. Section 6.1 also details the effectiveness of our training strategy, showing System B (with the refined verification model) significantly outperforms System A (without it) and the base system. The reviewer may have overlooked these detailed comparisons. We will revise the abstract to further emphasize the specific performance gains and the role of the training strategy.\n\n*   **Unlabeled axes in figures:** We acknowledge this weakness. We will revise Figures 5 and 6 to include clear labels and units on the axes, ensuring clarity in result interpretation.\n\n*   **Dataset licensing, usage terms, consent, or privacy considerations:** We acknowledge the lack of this information. We will add a section detailing the datasets used, their licenses (Entailment Bank and QASC are publicly available), and any usage restrictions in the next version. We will also include a statement regarding consent and privacy, as these datasets are publicly available and do not involve personally identifiable information.\n\n*   **Lack of clear definition of 'model exploitation':** We respectfully disagree. The paper *does* define 'model exploitation' in Section 1 ('Why is it challenging?'). We will add a more concise definition early in the introduction to ensure clarity.\n\n*   **Lack of discussion on potential misuse cases, fairness considerations, or broader impacts:** We acknowledge this omission. We will add a Broader Impact section to the conclusion, discussing potential misuse, fairness considerations, and broader impacts, along with mitigation strategies.\n\n*   **Lack of mention of seeds and variance:** We acknowledge this omission. We used a fixed random seed for all experiments. We will include the random seeds used for all experiments and report the standard deviation across multiple runs in the next version. This information will be added to Section 6.1 and Appendix C.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Include random seeds and variance:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Provide a link to the code repository:** We plan to release the code upon publication. We will provide a link to the code repository and include a requirements.txt file.\n\n*   **In-depth analysis of the training strategy:** We believe Section 6.1 already provides a good analysis. We will add more details to the ablation studies to demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating model exploitation and its impact on overall performance.\n\n*   **Ensure all axes are clearly labeled:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Include a section detailing the datasets used, their licenses, and any usage restrictions:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Provide a clear description of the table structure:** We believe Table 1 is already clear, but we will add standard deviations, confidence intervals, and p-values to indicate statistical significance of the results in the next version.\n\n*   **Provide a concise definition of 'model exploitation' early in the introduction:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Add a Broader Impact section:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Ablation study comparing to Creswell et al. (2023):** We respectfully disagree. Creswell et al. (2023) is similar to the LLM version of our base system, and we compare with them in section 6.3. We will add more details to the ablation studies to demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating model exploitation and its impact on overall performance. We will add more details to the ablation studies to demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating model exploitation and its impact on overall performance.\n\nWe believe these revisions will significantly improve the clarity and impact of our paper. Thank you again for the valuable feedback."
