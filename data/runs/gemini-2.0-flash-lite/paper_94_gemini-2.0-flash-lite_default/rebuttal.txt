    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of clear definition of 'latent representation' and architecture/training details of the latent synthesizer:** The reviewer is correct that a more explicit definition would be beneficial. We believe the reviewer may have overlooked the details in the paper. The 'latent representation' refers to the output of the speech latent encoder, which is derived from a pre-trained ASR model. The architecture of the speech latent encoder is described in Section 3.2.1, and the training details are in Section 4.2.1 and 4.2.2. The dimensionality of the latent representation is implicitly defined by the pre-trained ASR model's output dimension, which is 512 in our experiments. We will clarify this in the revised version by explicitly stating the dimensionality and adding a sentence to Section 3.2.1 to define the latent representation more clearly.\n\n*   **Lack of detailed comparison with relevant prior work:** We believe the reviewer may have overlooked the comparisons in the paper. Section 2, 'Related Works,' discusses modality conversion and unified representation learning, which are the most relevant prior works. Section 4.3 and 4.4 provide detailed comparisons with published works that utilize text data augmentation. We will enhance the discussion in Section 2 to further clarify the delta and advantages of LaSyn, specifically highlighting the differences in approach and performance compared to these methods.\n\n*   **Lack of statistical information in tables:** We acknowledge this weakness. We will include standard deviations and confidence intervals in Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 to quantify the variability of the results. We will also perform t-tests to assess the statistical significance of the improvements.\n\n*   **Lack of detailed labels on figures:** We will improve the labels on Figures 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 to provide clearer explanations of the components and stages of the processes. We will add axis labels and legends where appropriate.\n\n*   **Lack of discussion on potential biases and misuse cases:** We acknowledge this is an important point. We will add a new section to the paper discussing potential biases in the training data and their impact on the model's performance. We will also address potential misuse cases and the ethical implications of our technology.\n\n*   **Lack of comparison with Transformer Transducer [1] and discussion of computational cost:** We will add a direct comparison with the Transformer Transducer [1] in terms of ASR performance on the LibriSpeech dataset. We will also include a section in the experimental results that compares the computational cost of LaSyn with other data augmentation techniques.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **More detailed explanation of the latent representation:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Direct comparison with a strong baseline:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Statistical significance tests and standard deviations:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Ablation studies:** We already include ablation studies in Section 5 to analyze the impact of different components of the LaSyn framework and the contribution of the latent representation.\n\n*   **Section on potential misuse cases and biases:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Experiment comparing LaSyn with Transformer Transducer [1] and computational cost:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Explicit license and consent statements:** We will add explicit license and consent statements for the datasets used in the revised version.\n\nWe believe these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
