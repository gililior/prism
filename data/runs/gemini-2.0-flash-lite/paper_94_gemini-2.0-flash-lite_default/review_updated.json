  "summary": "This paper introduces LaSyn, a novel framework for end-to-end speech processing that leverages textual data to address the challenge of limited labeled speech data. LaSyn demonstrates promising results on both ASR and SLU tasks, achieving relative WER reductions on Librispeech and improvements on SLURP, but lacks crucial details and comparisons to fully establish its advantages. The authors have addressed some of the weaknesses raised in the initial review, including clarifying the definition of the latent representation and providing more detailed comparisons with prior work.",
