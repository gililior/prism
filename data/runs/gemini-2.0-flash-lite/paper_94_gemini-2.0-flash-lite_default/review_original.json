  "summary": "This paper introduces LaSyn, a novel framework for end-to-end speech processing that leverages textual data to address the challenge of limited labeled speech data. LaSyn demonstrates promising results on both ASR and SLU tasks, achieving relative WER reductions on Librispeech and improvements on SLURP, but lacks crucial details and comparisons to fully establish its advantages.",
