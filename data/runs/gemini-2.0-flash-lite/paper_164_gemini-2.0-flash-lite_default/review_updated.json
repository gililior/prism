  "summary": "This paper explores using GPTk models to improve the prompt editing process for text-to-image generation. While the approach is novel and the paper provides details on human evaluation setup, the work is limited by a lack of detailed comparisons, insufficient statistical analysis, and a lack of reproducibility due to missing code and seed information.",
