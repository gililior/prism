    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Weakness 1: Lack of statistical analysis of human evaluation results.** The reviewer is correct that we did not explicitly report inter-annotator agreement and variance in Section A.4. We acknowledge this omission and will include Cohen's Kappa to measure inter-annotator agreement and standard deviations for the human evaluation results in the revised version. We will also clarify the methodology used to calculate the agreement. \n\n*   **Weakness 2: Lack of seeds, code, and environment.** We respectfully disagree. While we did not explicitly state the seeds used, we mention that the results reported in the following sections are the mean of three repeated runs (Section 2). We will add the specific seeds used for each experiment in the revised version to ensure reproducibility. We are unable to release the code and environment due to the proprietary nature of the dataset and the API access restrictions of the GPT models. However, we will provide a detailed description of the experimental setup, including the specific parameters used for each GPTk model and the Stable Diffusion model, in the Appendix.\n\n*   **Weakness 3: Lack of comparison with existing methods.** We acknowledge this weakness. We will expand the Related Work section to include a more detailed comparison with existing prompt optimization and editing techniques, including those that utilize reinforcement learning and other LLMs. We will highlight the novelty of our approach in comparison to these methods.\n\n*   **Weakness 4: Insufficient detail on GPTk models, experimental setup, and evaluation metrics.** We believe the reviewer may have overlooked some details. Section 2 provides a detailed description of the GPTk models used, including their names and parameter sizes (Table 1). Section 2 also describes the experimental setup, including the dataset, annotations, and procedure. The evaluation metrics, including CLIP cosine similarity and RNE, are clearly defined in Section 2. We will clarify the descriptions further to avoid any confusion.\n\n*   **Weakness 5: Lack of clear axis labels and units, and missing legends.** The reviewer is correct. We will add clear axis labels with units to all plots (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and include legends to clarify the meaning of different lines and colors in the plots. We will also add error bars to show variance.\n\n*   **Weakness 6: Lack of definition of 'edit'.** We respectfully disagree. The definition of 'edit' is provided in the Abstract and Section 1, where we explain that it refers to the changes made to the prompt. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of edits per trace. We will clarify the definition further in the revised version.\n\n*   **Weakness 7: Lack of statistical information in tables.** We acknowledge this weakness. We will include standard deviations and confidence intervals in Table 2 to show the variability of the results. We will add p-values to Table 3 to indicate the statistical significance of the head-to-head comparison results. We will also provide clear headers and descriptions for all tables.\n\n*   **Weakness 8: Lack of discussion on potential misuse scenarios and ethics statement depth.** We acknowledge this omission. We will include a section on potential misuse scenarios, such as generating harmful or misleading content, and expand the Ethics Statement to address these concerns more comprehensively.\n\n*   **Weakness 9: Lack of discussion on potential biases in GPTk models.** We acknowledge this weakness. We will include a discussion on potential biases in the GPTk models and their impact on the generated images in the revised version.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Suggestion 1: Provide code, seeds, and variance.** We will add the specific seeds used for each experiment in the revised version. We are unable to release the code and environment due to the proprietary nature of the dataset and the API access restrictions of the GPT models.\n\n*   **Suggestion 2: Comparative analysis with existing prompt optimization techniques.** We will expand the Related Work section as described above.\n\n*   **Suggestion 3: More detailed description of GPTk models.** We believe the reviewer may have overlooked some details. Section 2 provides a detailed description of the GPTk models used, including their size, training data, and any fine-tuning performed (Table 1). We will clarify the descriptions further to avoid any confusion.\n\n*   **Suggestion 4: Add axis labels, legends, and error bars.** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Suggestion 5: Include standard deviations, confidence intervals, and p-values.** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Suggestion 6: Include a section on potential misuse.** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Suggestion 7: Discuss potential biases.** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Suggestion 8: Expand discussion on broader impacts.** We will expand the discussion on broader impacts, including the environmental impact of the computational resources used and the potential economic impacts on content creators.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
