  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel pre-training technique, 'query-as-context pre-training,' to address the issue of weakly correlated passages in context-supervised pre-training methods. The approach demonstrates improved performance on multiple datasets, but the paper still lacks sufficient detail on experimental setup and statistical rigor, although the authors have clarified some aspects of their work.",
