    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time taken to carefully review our paper and provide constructive criticism. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Insufficient details on pretraining and fine-tuning processes:** The reviewer notes a lack of detail in Section 4. We believe that Section 4.1 and 4.2 provide sufficient details on the pre-training and fine-tuning processes, including the datasets, model implementations, and hyperparameter settings. We will add a sentence to the beginning of Section 4 to explicitly state that we will provide the details of the pre-training and fine-tuning processes. We will also include a link to our code repository in the final version to provide more details on the experimental environment.\n\n*   **Missing evidence for efficiency and statistical significance:** The reviewer correctly points out the lack of explicit efficiency results and statistical significance. While we mention efficiency gains in the abstract and introduction, we did not provide quantitative evidence. We will add a new section in the appendix to analyze the pre-training time of query-as-context pre-training and the baseline methods. We will also report the seed used for all experiments and the variance across multiple runs, including standard deviations or confidence intervals. We will add a sentence to the beginning of Section 4.5 to explicitly state that we will report the seed used for all experiments and the variance across multiple runs.\n\n*   **Lack of precise definition and notation:** We acknowledge the need for a more precise definition of 'query-as-context pre-training' and a clear notation section. We will add a dedicated section in the revised manuscript to formally define our method and include a table of notations. We will also add a sentence to the beginning of the abstract and introduction to explicitly state that we will provide a more precise definition of 'query-as-context pre-training' and a clear notation section.\n\n*   **Lack of comparison with methods in [1] and [3]:** We respectfully disagree with this point. Our paper builds upon the methods in [1] (Gao and Callan, 2021b) and [3] (Wu et al., 2022). We compare our method with the baselines from [1] and [3] in Table 1 and Table 2. We will add a sentence to the related work section to explicitly state that we compare our method with the baselines from [1] and [3] in Table 1 and Table 2.\n\n*   **Dataset license and usage restrictions and potential misuse:** We acknowledge the importance of addressing dataset licenses and potential misuse. We will add a section to the appendix to explicitly state the dataset licenses and usage restrictions. We will also add a Broader Impact section with mitigation strategies.\n\n*   **Figure 3 lacks detailed axis labels:** We will add detailed axis labels to Figure 3 in the revised manuscript.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Detailed experimental setup and code repository:** We will provide a more detailed description of the experimental setup, including the specific datasets used, evaluation metrics, and a link to the code repository with environment details. (addressed above)\n\n*   **Report seed and variance:** We will report the seed used for all experiments and the variance across multiple runs, including standard deviations or confidence intervals and p-values. (addressed above)\n\n*   **License and consent statements and Broader Impact section:** We will add explicit license and consent statements for datasets used and a Broader Impact section with mitigation strategies. (addressed above)\n\n*   **Comparison with methods in [1] and [3]:** We believe that our current experimental setup already compares our method with the methods in [1] and [3]. (addressed above)\n\n*   **Detailed explanation of query generation and notation table:** We will provide a more detailed explanation of the query generation process and include a notation table to define all symbols used in equations. (addressed above)\n\n*   **Error bars in Figure 2:** We will add error bars to Figure 2 in the revised manuscript."
