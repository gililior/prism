    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weakness 1:** The paper lacks details on the number of experts, inter-rater reliability, and the methodology used for creating the C2D2 dataset, including annotation guidelines and inter-annotator agreement. (Sec 3.4, Intro)\n\n*Response:* We partially address this. Section 3.4 discusses expert evaluation, and Section 3.5 details data quality assurance, including inter-annotator agreement (Kappa score of 0.67). We will expand on the number of experts involved in the expert evaluation in Section 3.4 and provide more details on the annotation guidelines in the revised version. We will also clarify the methodology used for calculating the Kappa score.\n\n**Weakness 2:** The paper does not provide sufficient comparative evidence to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, nor does it address the use of pre-trained models or compare its approach with existing methods. (Intro, Related Work)\n\n*Response:* We respectfully disagree. Section 5.1 and Table 5 present the performance of baseline models, including pre-trained models. We compare the performance of finetuning different pretrained models and large language models using in-context learning on C2D2 dataset. We will add a more detailed comparison with existing mental disorder detection models in the revised version, incorporating cognitive distortion features, and evaluate the performance of the proposed model with and without incorporating user cognitive distortion information for mental disorder detection.\n\n**Weakness 3:** The paper overclaims the impact of the dataset on mental health interventions and lacks sufficient evidence to support its claims, particularly regarding real-world effectiveness. (Sec 7, 9.2)\n\n*Response:* We acknowledge this concern. While Section 7 and 9.2 highlight the potential benefits, we will revise the language to be more cautious and emphasize the dataset's contribution to research rather than immediate real-world impact. We will also add a discussion of the limitations of our findings in Section 8.\n\n**Weakness 4:** The paper lacks essential statistical measures (standard deviation, confidence intervals, p-values) in several tables, making it difficult to assess the significance of the results. (Tables 3, 5, 8)\n\n*Response:* We agree. We will include standard deviations and confidence intervals for all reported metrics in Tables 5 and 8 in the revised version. We will also add p-values to indicate statistical significance when comparing different models or settings.\n\n**Weakness 5-8:** The paper does not address critical ethical considerations, including consent, privacy, usage terms, potential risks, and potential for misuse. (Insufficient evidence)\n\n*Response:* We partially address this. Section 9.1 discusses ethical considerations, including IRB approval and informed consent. However, we will expand this section to include a more detailed discussion of potential misuse cases, address potential biases in the C2D2 dataset and the models trained on it, and propose mitigation strategies. We will also add a section on usage terms and clarify data privacy measures.\n\n**Weakness 9:** The paper lacks details on code or data availability, and does not mention the use of seeds or the variance of the results. (Entire paper)\n\n*Response:* We acknowledge this. We will provide a link to the code repository and data (if approved by our IRB) and specify the seeds used for all experiments, reporting the variance across multiple runs in the revised version.\n\n**Suggestions:** We have addressed the suggestions by incorporating the relevant changes in the response to the weaknesses. We will also add a Broader Impact section that explicitly addresses the potential societal consequences of the research, both positive and negative, and proposes mitigation strategies for potential harms."
