  "summary": "This paper introduces the C2D2 dataset, a novel Chinese dataset for cognitive distortion analysis, and explores its potential for mental health applications. While the dataset and baseline experiments are promising, the paper lacks crucial details regarding methodology, ethical considerations, and comparative analysis, limiting the impact of the findings. Addressing these weaknesses is essential for strengthening the paper's contribution.",
