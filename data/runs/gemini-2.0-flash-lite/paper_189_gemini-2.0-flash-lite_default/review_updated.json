  "summary": "This paper introduces the C2D2 dataset, a novel Chinese dataset for cognitive distortion analysis, and explores its potential for mental health applications. The dataset and baseline experiments are promising. The authors have clarified some methodological details and addressed some ethical considerations, but further improvements are needed to strengthen the paper's contribution, particularly regarding comparative analysis, ethical considerations, and real-world impact.",
