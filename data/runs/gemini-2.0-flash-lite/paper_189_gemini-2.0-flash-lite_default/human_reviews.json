      "paper_topic_and_main_contributions": "This paper is about mental health analysis topic. The main contributions are: a publicly accessible Chinese Cognitive Distortion Dataset is constructed for the first time. The authors explore the association between cognitive distortions and various mental disorders on social media. The authors attempt to incorporate information about users\u2019 cognitive distortions into mental disorder detection models to illustrate the effectiveness of using cognitive distortion.",
      "reasons_to_accept": "The C2D2 dataset is valuable for the mental health field. It is a publicly accessible resource within this domain that includes numerous texts recording individuals\u2019 thoughts in various scenes with cognitive distortion. This dataset provides a profound connection between cognitive distortions and mental disorders. Addressing these distortions could potentially enhance mental health interventions. The authors find that integrating cognitive distortions as an additional feature can augment the performance of existing mental disorder detection models. In addition, the overall structure is well-organised.",
      "reasons_to_reject": "The motivation \"However, mental health issues in developing countries often receive limited attention\" described for not annotating the dataset in English is inaccurate. English has a broader applicability, and the authors could also consider incorporating English annotations. While developing countries are essential to consider, it is also worthwhile to focus on datasets in languages other than Chinese.\nFor the test datasets, do the authors consider post-level model tests? Because the C2D2 is also the post-level dataset. Additionally, some other datasets could be added, like SWMH, T-SID, etc. \nIn Sec 6.2, the authors should train the RoBERTa-based model because of the performance shown in Table 5. \nIn Fig.4, do all posts with depression or PTSD have cognitive distortions? Add Non-sd labels?\nThere is no human expert performance on this dataset.\nMany details need to be expressed clearly. What is the meaning of ppopularity in (4)?\nThe reasonable about \"extracting posts that contain cognitive distortions\" should be discussed.  Why not other methods?\nIf possible, it is suggested that the problem could be treated as a multi-label task when multiple cognitive distortions occur simultaneously.",

      "paper_topic_and_main_contributions": "In this paper, the authors propose a cognitive distortion dataset in Chinese, consisting of 7,500 examples with paired scenes, thoughts, and cognitive distortion labels. For the dataset construction, the authors do not take the traditional approach of annotating online posts, but instead recruit volunteers and use interviews to further select qualified volunteers. The volunteers are instructed to compose thoughts based on the given scene, and also label the thoughts composed by other volunteers. The quality of the dataset is further evaluated by experts.  The authors conduct experiments using various baseline models including fully-supervised training, as well as few-shot and zero-shot using ChatGPT, demonstrating the challenge of this dataset. The author also conducts experiments and comprehensive analysis using the cognitive detection model on datasets from social media, showing the correlations between cognitive distortions and various mental health disorders.",
      "reasons_to_accept": "1. The proposed new dataset is very valuable, as currently, there is a lack of publically available datasets in the mental health domain. Such a dataset will greatly boost the research for NLP in assisting mental health treatment. \n2. The proposed dataset is the first one for Chinese. This is especially valuable since, in China, the scarcity of mental health professionals and resources is even more severe. There is an increasing demand for building automatic assistance for mental health support. \n3. The dataset shows good quality, verified by experts. \n4. The experiments and analysis demonstrate the great potential of the vast scope of future research that can be extended based on this dataset.",
      "reasons_to_reject": "1. No evaluation regarding the human expert performance on this dataset. \n2. The dataset construction process involves asking the volunteers to \"compose\" distorted thoughts but not taking the thoughts from potential patients with mental disorders from online posts. Such a method, theoretically as a kind of proxy to the thoughts of real patients,  is further verified by experts, as stated in the paper. However, I'm wondering what the gap is between the thoughts from real patients and the composed thoughts.",

It also examines its use in previously collected datasets with social media data from users with mental illnesses.",

Unclear of potential biases in the demographics of the volunteers who generated the data. The biases and limitations of the dataset due to it being generated by volunteers and then corrected should be discussed. As well, since the authors use social media datasets it's unverifiable if the users are formally diagnosed, thus the findings discussed on 449 to 453 and 465 to 471 as well of the rest of the section should emphasize how these findings are based on self-disclosure and potential self-diagnosis.",

The authors then perform machine learning experiments to test whether cognitive distortions are possible to detect automatically from text, and also test their relation to mental disorders, based on some English datasets annotated for depression and PTSD.\nThe dataset is created through a complex and rigorous process: by first doing a selection for choosing the set of responders, then asking them to produce examples of cognitive distortions, which are then verified by experts for different criteria. The dataset is made public.\nIn the experiments, pretrained LLMs are used to detect cognitive distortions in the proposed dataset and in the English mental disorders dataset, using machine translation to make the datasets compatible (following two objectives: measuring the prevalence of cognitive distortions in mental health disorder data using the trained models, and trying to improve mental disorder detection using cognitive distortion information).\nAll the responders used for creating the dataset have agreed to participate in the study, and the ethical section contains a thorough discussion.",
