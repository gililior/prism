  "summary": "This paper introduces the Adaptive Language-guided Multimodal Transformer (ALMT) to address the problem of disruptive information in multimodal sentiment analysis. The paper presents a novel approach and provides a clear overview of the proposed pipeline. The authors have addressed some of the initial concerns regarding reproducibility, statistical rigor, and thorough comparison with existing methods in their rebuttal, but further improvements are still needed.",
