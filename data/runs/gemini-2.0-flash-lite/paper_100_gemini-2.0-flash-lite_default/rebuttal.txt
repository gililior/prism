    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Reproducibility (Seeds, Variance, Experimental Setup):** The reviewer points out the lack of information on seeds, variance, and experimental setup. We acknowledge this is a valid concern. While we did not explicitly state the random seeds used, we will include this information in the revised manuscript. We will also report the standard deviation of the results across multiple runs (e.g., 5 runs) for all key experiments in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. We will also provide details on the experimental setup, including the hardware and software configurations, in the Appendix.\n\n*   **Performance Details and Statistical Rigor:** The reviewer requests more specific details on datasets, improvement extents, and statistical rigor. We believe we already provide substantial detail on datasets in Section 4.1, including dataset sizes and sentiment score ranges. We also present quantitative results in Tables 1 and 2, comparing ALMT with state-of-the-art methods. We will enhance the analysis by including standard deviations and, where appropriate, p-values to assess statistical significance. We will also add a section in the results to explicitly state the relative improvements achieved by ALMT over the baselines.\n\n*   **Comparison to Existing Methods and Novelty:** The reviewer seeks a more detailed comparison to existing methods and clarification of novelty. We believe Section 2 (Related Work) already provides a comprehensive overview of existing methods. We will expand this section to include a more detailed architectural comparison with the top-cited papers, specifically highlighting the key innovations of ALMT. We will also add a discussion on how ALMT addresses the limitations of previous work.\n\n*   **Figure Clarity (Axis Labels):** The reviewer correctly points out the lack of axis labels in Figures 3, 8, 9, and 10. We will revise these figures to include clear axis labels and units where applicable.\n\n*   **Dataset Information, Licenses, and Bias:** The reviewer raises concerns about dataset information, licenses, consent procedures, privacy considerations, and potential biases. We acknowledge the importance of these aspects. We will add a new section to the paper detailing the licenses and usage terms for all datasets. We will also include a discussion of potential biases present in the datasets and their potential impact on the model's performance. We will also add a statement about the consent procedures followed by the original dataset creators.\n\n*   **Statistical Information in Tables:** The reviewer notes the lack of statistical information such as standard deviations, confidence intervals, or p-values in Tables 1-9. We will address this by including standard deviations for all reported results and adding p-values to indicate statistical significance when comparing different methods or configurations.\n\n*   **Hyper-modality Definition and Notation:** The reviewer requests clarification on the definition of 'hyper-modality' and a notation section. We will clarify the definition of 'hyper-modality' in the introduction and methods sections. We will also add a dedicated notation section to define all symbols and variables used in the equations and model descriptions.\n\n*   **Bias, Misuse, and Ethical Implications:** The reviewer highlights the need to address potential biases, misuse cases, and ethical implications. We will add a section discussing potential biases in the training data and how they might affect the model's performance. We will also include a discussion of potential misuse cases and ethical considerations, such as the use of the model in surveillance or emotion detection.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Code, Data, and Environment:** We agree with the suggestion to provide code, data, and environment details. We will release the code and data used in our experiments, along with a Dockerfile to ensure reproducibility.\n\n*   **Dataset and Performance Details:** We believe we already provide specific details about the datasets used and the performance improvements achieved, including quantitative results (Section 4.1, Tables 1 & 2). We will enhance this by adding a section in the results to explicitly state the relative improvements achieved by ALMT over the baselines.\n\n*   **Statistical Significance:** We will include standard deviations or confidence intervals for all reported results to assess statistical significance, and add p-values to indicate statistical significance when comparing different methods or configurations (Tables 1-9).\n\n*   **Hyperparameter Search:** We will add details on the hyperparameter search strategy and the final hyperparameters used in the Appendix (Table 9).\n\n*   **Head-to-Head Comparison:** We will implement a head-to-head comparison with the most relevant existing methods, including quantitative results and ablation studies, and perform a head-to-head comparison with [1] by implementing their method and comparing performance on the same datasets.\n\n*   **Figure Labels:** We will add labels to the axes and legends to clarify the meaning of the plots in Figures 3, 8, 9, and 10. Include units where applicable.\n\n*   **Dataset Licenses and Bias:** We will explicitly state the licenses and usage terms for all datasets used in the paper. We will also provide information on how consent was obtained and address any privacy considerations, and analyze the datasets for potential biases and discuss the impact of these biases on the model's performance.\n\n*   **AHL Module and Notation:** We will provide a more detailed explanation of the AHL module, including the specific language features used and how they guide the visual and audio modalities, and include a notation table to define all symbols and variables used in the equations and model descriptions.\n\n*   **Bias, Misuse, and Ethical Considerations:** We will include a discussion of potential biases in the training data and how they might affect the model's performance. Consider mitigation strategies, and add a section on potential misuse cases and ethical considerations, such as the use of the model in surveillance or emotion detection.\n\n*   **Comparison to Prior Work:** We will include a detailed discussion of the differences between the proposed method and [2, 3], highlighting the key innovations and how they address the limitations of previous work.\n\nWe believe that incorporating these changes will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our paper. We are grateful for the reviewer's constructive feedback and are committed to addressing all concerns in the revised manuscript."
