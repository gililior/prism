    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback, which has significantly helped us improve the clarity and completeness of our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Statistical Significance (Tables 2, 3):** The reviewer points out the lack of statistical significance information in Tables 2 and 3. We acknowledge this omission and will address it in the next version. While we presented accuracy scores, we did not include confidence intervals, standard deviations, or p-values. We will incorporate these metrics to provide a more rigorous statistical analysis of the results. Specifically, we plan to calculate confidence intervals for the accuracy scores in Tables 2 and 3, and potentially perform statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) to compare the performance of different GPT models. We will also include the standard deviation of the results.\n\n*   **Reproducibility (Section 5):** The reviewer notes the lack of information regarding seeds and variance across runs. We agree that this is crucial for reproducibility. In Section 5, we state that we set the temperature to 0 when using all GPT models to ensure replicability. However, we did not explicitly mention the use of seeds. We will add a sentence in Section 5 stating that we used specific seeds for all experiments involving GPT models and will provide these seeds in the Appendix. We will also run multiple trials with different seeds and report the variance in the results.\n\n*   **Comparison with Existing BTL Work (Related Work):** The reviewer requests a more detailed comparison with existing work using BTL or similar techniques for analyzing human preference judgments. We respectfully disagree with the assessment that this is entirely missing. While we acknowledge that the Related Work section could be expanded, we do discuss the application of the BTL model in the context of NLP and human evaluation. We cite relevant papers that have used BTL in similar contexts (Dras, 2015; Zopf, 2018; Peyrard et al., 2017, 2021; Sedoc and Ungar, 2020). In the next version, we will expand this section to include a more detailed comparison, highlighting the similarities and differences between our approach and existing work, and providing a more in-depth discussion of the advantages of our methodology.\n\n*   **Axis Labels and Factor Definition (Figures 6, 7):** The reviewer points out the lack of clear axis labels and units in Figures 6 and 7, and the lack of a clear definition of 'factors'. We acknowledge this and will revise Figures 6 and 7 to include clear axis labels and units. We will also add a more precise definition of 'factors' in Section 2 and provide a more detailed explanation of how these factors are operationalized in Section 3. We will clarify that the factors are high-level, interpretable descriptors of the summaries and their original texts.\n\n*   **Misuse, Fairness, and Societal Impacts (Insufficient Evidence):** We agree with the reviewer that addressing potential misuse, fairness considerations, and broader societal impacts is crucial. We will add a Broader Impact section in the next version of the paper, discussing these aspects in detail. We will also include a discussion of fairness considerations, acknowledging the potential for biases in the data and the importance of constructing balanced datasets.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Variance and Seeds (All sections):** We will incorporate the reviewer's suggestion to provide details on the variance of the results, such as standard deviations or confidence intervals, and include the seeds used for all experiments. This is addressed in our response to the second weakness.\n\n*   **Quantitative Comparison and Ablation Study (Sec 4.1, Sec 3.2):** We will consider adding a quantitative comparison against a strong baseline and conducting an ablation study to determine the relative importance of different factors. However, given the scope of the current paper, we will prioritize the inclusion of statistical significance and reproducibility details. We will explore the feasibility of including these additional analyses in future work.\n\n*   **License and Consent Statements (Introduction):** We will add explicit license and consent statements for datasets used and provide a more detailed explanation of the factors considered in the analysis. We will clarify the source of the data and the terms of use.\n\n*   **BTL Model and GPT-4 Explanation (Introduction):** We will add a brief section explaining the BTL model and clarify the role of GPT-4 in the analysis. We will clarify that GPT-4 is used to extract and assess the factors, not to perform the BTL analysis itself.\n\n*   **Broader Impact and Fairness (Conclusion):** We will add a Broader Impact section and discuss fairness considerations in the Conclusion, as addressed in our response to the fifth weakness.\n\n*   **Experiment Comparing BTL with Other Methods ([2], Intro, Related Work, [1]):** We will consider conducting an experiment comparing the performance of the BTL model with methods described in [2] and analyzing the impact of output length, informativeness, fluency, and factual consistency. However, given the scope of the current paper, we will prioritize the inclusion of statistical significance and reproducibility details. We will explore the feasibility of including these additional analyses in future work.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly enhance the quality and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
