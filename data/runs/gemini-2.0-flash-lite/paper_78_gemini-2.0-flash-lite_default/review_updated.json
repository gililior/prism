  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel graph-based text decomposition and augmentation framework with a coarse-to-fine contrastive learning objective for improving compositional reasoning in vision-language models. The paper demonstrates improved performance over baselines, but lacks crucial details regarding reproducibility, statistical significance, and ethical considerations. The authors have addressed some of the weaknesses raised in the initial review, particularly regarding the inclusion of seeds and variance reporting, and figure clarity. The authors have also clarified existing content regarding comparisons with CREPE and feature distortion.",
