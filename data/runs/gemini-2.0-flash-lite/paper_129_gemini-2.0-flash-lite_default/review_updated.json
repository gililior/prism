  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel approach to address annotator disagreement by creating annotator and annotation embeddings, demonstrating improved accuracy on the TID-8 benchmark dataset. The method shows promise, but the paper's generalizability is still limited by its focus on TID-8. The paper lacks a detailed comparison with existing methods and detailed analysis of potential biases.",
