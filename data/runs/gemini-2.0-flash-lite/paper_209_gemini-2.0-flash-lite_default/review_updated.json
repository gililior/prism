  "summary": "This paper introduces mLongT5, a model combining long-sequence handling with multilingual capabilities. The paper demonstrates improved performance on question answering and summarization tasks. The authors have clarified some aspects of the model and its evaluation based on the rebuttals, including the datasets used and the multilingual capabilities. However, the lack of sufficient comparative evidence and clarity in certain areas, such as the efficient attention mechanism and statistical significance of results, still limits the overall assessment.",
