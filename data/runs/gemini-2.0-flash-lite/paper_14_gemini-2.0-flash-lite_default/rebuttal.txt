    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback, which has helped us identify areas for improvement in our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Reproducibility (Seeds & Variance):** The paper does not explicitly state the random seeds used or report variance. We acknowledge this is a critical aspect of reproducibility. **Action:** We will include the random seeds used for all experiments and report the standard deviation across multiple runs for key results in the revised manuscript, particularly in Tables 3, 4, and 5. (Section 4.5)\n\n*   **Comparison with Speech Enhancement Techniques:** The paper does not explicitly compare with existing speech enhancement techniques. While our NSA module implicitly addresses noise, a direct comparison would strengthen our claims. **Action:** We will include a comparative analysis with a state-of-the-art speech enhancement method in the revised manuscript, demonstrating the advantages of our proposed NSA module. (Intro, Related Work)\n\n*   **NSA/SJS Architecture Detail:** The paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the NSA and SJS modules. We will expand the descriptions of these modules, including their specific functions and how they contribute to the overall goal. **Action:** We will include a diagram illustrating the STBridge architecture and the interaction between its components (NSA, SJS, and the R-VOS model) in the revised manuscript. (Intro)\n\n*   **Plot/Table Clarity:** The reviewer points out the lack of clear labels and units in Figure 6 and the need for more descriptive table captions. **Action:** We will add clear labels to the axes of Figure 6, including units where applicable. We will also provide more descriptive captions for the tables, summarizing the key findings. (Figure 6, Tables 2-5)\n\n*   **Semantic Jitter Definition:** The term 'semantic jitter' is introduced without a clear definition. We acknowledge this and will clarify the definition. **Action:** We will define 'semantic jitter' more precisely, possibly with a mathematical formulation or illustrative examples, in the revised manuscript. (Abstract, Introduction)\n\n*   **STBridge Architecture Explanation:** The paper lacks a clear explanation of the STBridge module's architecture. We will address this by providing a clearer explanation of the STBridge module, including how NSA and SJS interact. **Action:** We will include a diagram illustrating the STBridge architecture and the interaction between its components (NSA, SJS, and the R-VOS model) in the revised manuscript. (Introduction ยง1)\n\n*   **Comparison with [1] and [3]:** The paper does not explicitly compare with the methods in [1] and [3]. We will address this by comparing with [1] and [3] by implementing the proposed modules on top of their architectures. **Action:** We will conduct an ablation study to isolate the performance gain of the NSA and SJS modules, comparing them against a baseline R-VOS model (e.g., ReferFormer or MTTR) without these modules. Also, compare with [1] and [3] by implementing the proposed modules on top of their architectures. (Sec 4.1)\n\n*   **Limitations Discussion:** The paper does not discuss the limitations of the proposed approach. We will address this by adding a limitations section. **Action:** We will add a limitations section to the paper, discussing the performance on different types of noise or accents in speech. (Related Work)\n\n*   **Dataset Licensing:** The paper does not state dataset licensing and usage restrictions. **Action:** We will add explicit license and consent statements for datasets used. (Insufficient evidence)\n\n*   **Statistical Information:** Several tables lack crucial statistical information. We will address this by including standard deviations or confidence intervals to indicate the variability of the results. **Action:** We will add standard deviations or confidence intervals to indicate the variability of the results. Add p-values to indicate statistical significance of performance differences between methods or configurations. (Tables 1, 3, 4, 5)\n\n*   **Experimental Environment:** The paper does not provide information about the experimental environment. **Action:** We will provide information about the environment used for the experiments, such as the specific versions of the software libraries and hardware. (Section 4.5)\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Code Repository:** We will provide a link to the code repository, including a requirements.txt or similar file to specify the software dependencies and their versions. Specify the hardware used for the experiments. (Section 3, 4.5)\n\n*   **ASR Baseline:** We will compare the performance of STBridge with a baseline that uses ASR followed by a standard text-based R-VOS model. (Intro)\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our work. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
