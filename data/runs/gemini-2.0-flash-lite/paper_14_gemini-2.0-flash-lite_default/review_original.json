  "summary": "This paper introduces STBridge, a novel method for speech-referring video object segmentation (RVOS) that addresses the underexplored area of speech input. The method incorporates Noise-Aware Semantic Adjustment (NSA) and Semantic Jitter Suppression (SJS) modules. While the paper demonstrates promising results, it lacks sufficient detail on the architecture and requires more rigorous comparisons and statistical analysis.",
