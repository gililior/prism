    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Reproducibility (Random Seeds):** The reviewer correctly points out the need for explicit mention of random seeds. While we reported the use of random seeds (3 random runs) in Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4, we did not explicitly state the specific seeds used. We acknowledge this omission and will include the random seeds used for each experiment in the paper's supplementary material to ensure complete reproducibility. (Sec 6.2, Sec 6.3)\n\n*   **Reproducibility (Architecture & Environment):** The reviewer requests more details on model architectures and the software environment. We believe that we have provided sufficient information. We use ROBERTA (Liu et al., 2019) as the backbone, and the architecture details are described in Section 3. We will add a more detailed description of the software environment, including the specific versions of libraries used (e.g., PyTorch, Transformers) in the supplementary material.\n\n*   **Hyperparameter Tuning & Model Definitions:** We acknowledge the need for more clarity on hyperparameter tuning and model definitions. We have included the hyperparameter details in Appendix A.1. We will clarify the definition of the 'joint CRF model' and 'constrained marginal model' in the introduction and throughout the paper, ensuring that the concepts are easily understood. (Sec 3, Abstract, ยง2)\n\n*   **Semi-Supervised Learning Evidence:** The reviewer questions the evidence for the benefits of semi-supervised learning. We respectfully disagree. We present a detailed comparison between the joint model and semi-supervised models in Section 6.3, demonstrating the improvements in out-of-domain generalization. We will strengthen the analysis by including more examples of the corrected and degraded predictions.\n\n*   **Dataset Licensing:** We acknowledge the lack of explicit dataset licensing and usage restrictions. We will add explicit license and consent statements for the CoNLL05 dataset in the revised version.\n\n*   **Input Construction Explanation:** The reviewer requests a clearer explanation of the input constructions. We will enhance the abstract to explicitly mention the input constructions used for VerbNet argument inference. We will also add more detailed explanations in Section 3 and Section 6.4.\n\n*   **Table 1 & p-values:** The reviewer notes the missing Table 1 and the lack of p-values in Table 3. Table 1 is a conceptual table and is not essential. We will add p-values or confidence intervals in Table 3 to clearly indicate the statistical significance of the improvements.\n\n*   **Risks, Fairness, and Broader Impacts:** We acknowledge the lack of discussion on potential risks, fairness considerations, and broader impacts. We will add a new section to address these aspects, including potential misuse cases and mitigation strategies.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Reproducibility (Detailed Description):** We will include the random seeds and a more detailed description of the software environment in the supplementary material, as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Model Architecture & Hyperparameter Tuning:** We believe we have provided sufficient information on the model architectures and hyperparameter tuning process. We will clarify the descriptions and add more details in the supplementary material.\n\n*   **Ablation Study:** We will conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component of the proposed method, as suggested. We will also analyze the performance of the model on different types of sentences and predicates.\n\n*   **Error Analysis:** We will provide a more detailed analysis of the types of errors corrected by the SEMLINK constraints, including examples of the corrected and degraded predictions, as suggested.\n\n*   **Dataset Licensing:** We will add explicit license and consent statements for datasets used, as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Figures & Model Explanation:** We will include figures to visualize the results, such as performance plots, and provide a more detailed explanation of the proposed models (joint CRF and constrained marginal model), as suggested.\n\n*   **p-values & Broader Impacts:** We will include p-values or confidence intervals in Table 3 and include a section on potential misuse cases and mitigation strategies, addressing fairness considerations and broader impacts, as suggested."
