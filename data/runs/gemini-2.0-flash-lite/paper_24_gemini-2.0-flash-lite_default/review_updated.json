  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel joint modeling approach for Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) using SEMLINK constraints, demonstrating improved performance over existing multitask learning methods. The paper's strengths lie in its clear presentation of the problem and the demonstration of performance gains, particularly with the use of SEMLINK constraints during inference. The paper has addressed some of the weaknesses raised in the initial review, including providing more details on reproducibility and dataset licensing. However, the paper still lacks crucial details regarding model architecture and a thorough analysis of its limitations and potential biases.",
