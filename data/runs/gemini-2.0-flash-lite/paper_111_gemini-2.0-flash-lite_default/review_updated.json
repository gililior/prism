  "summary": "This paper explores unsupervised word segmentation using self-supervised learning (SSL) models. The paper demonstrates promising results, but lacks crucial details regarding baselines, reproducibility, and statistical significance, hindering a complete assessment of its contributions. The authors have provided clarifications regarding the state-of-the-art comparison and ablation studies, but still need to address reproducibility and statistical significance concerns.",
