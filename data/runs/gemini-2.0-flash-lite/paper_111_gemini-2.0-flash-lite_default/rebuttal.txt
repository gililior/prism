    "rebuttal": "We thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the opportunity to clarify our work and address the concerns raised.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of clarity on state-of-the-art improvement:** The reviewer notes a lack of detail regarding the baseline and improvement calculation. We respectfully disagree. The abstract clearly states the improvement: \"Our method consistently improves the performance of each system and sets a new state-of-the-art that is, on average 130 % higher than the previous one as measured by the F1 score...\" (Abstract). Section 4.1, particularly Table 1, provides a direct comparison of our method's performance against the initial segmentation systems (baselines) and the previous state-of-the-art. The 130% improvement is relative to the previous state-of-the-art, which is explicitly cited in the table. We believe the reviewer may have overlooked this direct comparison.\n\n*   **Lack of reproducibility information:** The reviewer points out the absence of seeds, variance, and software environment details. We acknowledge this is a valid concern. While we detail the optimization process (Adam optimizer, learning rate, etc.) in Section 3, we did not explicitly mention the use of seeds for random number generators. We will include the specific seeds used for all random operations in the code and report the variance of the results across multiple runs in the next version of the paper. We will also provide a link to our code repository and include a requirements.txt file to specify the software environment and the specific versions of the libraries used.\n\n*   **Figure axis and label clarity:** The reviewer notes the lack of clear labels and units on figures. We acknowledge this and will improve the clarity of Figure 1 and Figure 2 by adding axis labels and units to make the comparisons more straightforward. We will also ensure that the figures are self-contained and easily interpretable.\n\n*   **Lack of statistical information in tables:** The reviewer requests standard deviations, confidence intervals, and p-values. We acknowledge this is a valid point. We will include standard deviations or confidence intervals for the F1 scores in all tables (Tables 1, 3, and 5) in the next version to better assess the significance of our results.\n\n*   **Missing XLS-R architecture and fine-tuning details:** The reviewer requests a dedicated section on the XLS-R architecture and fine-tuning. We respectfully disagree that this is entirely missing. Section 1.2 provides a brief overview of Wav2vec2.0 and XLS-R, including their architecture (convolutional front-end and transformer layers). Section 2 details our method, including the addition of a feed-forward layer and sigmoid activation, and the fine-tuning process. However, we agree that a more detailed explanation of the fine-tuning process, including the loss function used (negative cross-entropy) and the training data (boundaries produced by the segmentation system), would be beneficial. We will expand on this in the next version.\n\n*   **Lack of dataset licensing and misuse discussion:** The reviewer raises concerns about dataset licensing and potential misuse. We acknowledge this is an important consideration. We will add explicit license and consent statements for datasets used and include a Broader Impact section with mitigation strategies in the next version of the paper.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Detailed comparison with the best-performing system:** The reviewer suggests a detailed comparison with the best-performing system from the literature. We believe that Table 1 already provides this comparison, as it includes the performance of the state-of-the-art systems. We will clarify this in the revised version.\n\n*   **Ablation studies:** The reviewer suggests ablation studies. Table 2 already provides an ablation study, analyzing the impact of different components of our method. We will clarify this in the revised version.\n\n*   **Seeds and variance:** We will incorporate the suggestion to include seeds and variance information, as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Code repository and environment:** We will provide a code repository and requirements file, as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Error bars:** We will add error bars to the performance plots and include standard deviations or confidence intervals in the tables, as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Detailed fine-tuning explanation:** We will provide a more detailed explanation of the fine-tuning process, as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Broader Impact section:** We will add a Broader Impact section, as mentioned above.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity and reproducibility of our work. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
