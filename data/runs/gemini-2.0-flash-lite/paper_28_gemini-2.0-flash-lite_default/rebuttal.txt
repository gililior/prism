    "rebuttal": "We thank the reviewer for their thorough and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weakness 1: Lack of Comparison & Overstated Generalizability**\nWe respectfully disagree that the paper lacks sufficient evidence to distinguish our approach. We provide a detailed comparison to related work in Section 2, highlighting the key distinctions of our continual learning approach using human feedback, particularly in contrast to RLHF methods. We acknowledge the limitations of crowdworkers and cooperative user assumptions in Section 7 (Conclusion), where we explicitly discuss the potential for real-world user behavior to differ and the need for future work on adversarial robustness. We believe the reviewer may have overlooked these sections.\n\n**Weakness 2: Insufficient Evidence for Design Choices**\nWe partially address this concern. Section 6.2 provides an analysis of model variants, including the impact of the answerability classification head and the update schedule (fewer interactions per round). While we acknowledge that more extensive experimentation could be beneficial, the results presented in Figure 3 offer evidence supporting our claims. We will consider adding more statistical analysis to this section in the next version.\n\n**Weakness 3: Ethical Shortcomings**\nWe acknowledge the ethical shortcomings and will address them in the revised version. We will include explicit dataset licenses and usage terms, provide details on the consent process for crowdworkers, and detail data anonymization and storage practices. We will also expand the discussion of ethical risks, including adversarial behavior, in Section 7.\n\n**Weakness 4: Figure and Table Deficiencies**\nWe acknowledge the need for improvement in figures and tables. We will add error bars (standard deviations or confidence intervals) to Figures 2, 4, and 5. We will ensure all axes are clearly labeled with units where applicable. We will provide a legend to clarify the meaning of different colors or line styles in Figures 4 and 5. We will include standard deviations and confidence intervals in Table 3 and add p-values to Table 4. We will also provide the number of examples used for training in Table 4.\n\n**Weakness 5: Lack of Methodology Section & Definition**\nWe acknowledge the lack of a dedicated methodology section. We will add a 'Methods' section detailing the model architecture, feedback mapping (Table 2), and learning algorithm (Algorithm 1 and Equation 1). We will also provide a concise definition of 'contextual bandit problem' in Section 1, or link to relevant resources.\n\n**Weakness 6: Lack of Discussion of Misuse**\nWe acknowledge this gap. We will add a Broader Impact section with mitigation strategies and include an ablation study to analyze the impact of different feedback noise levels on the continual learning process.\n\n**Suggestion 1: Head-to-Head Comparison**\nWe acknowledge the suggestion for a head-to-head comparison. Due to the novelty of our approach, direct comparisons with contemporaneous methods are challenging. However, we will consider including a baseline using a reward model trained on pairwise comparisons in future work, as suggested.\n\n**Suggestion 2: Experiments with Real Users**\nWe agree that experiments with real users would be valuable. However, this is beyond the scope of the current study. We will include this as future work in the conclusion.\n\n**Suggestion 3: Dataset Licensing, Consent, and Privacy**\nWe will implement this suggestion as described in our response to Weakness 3.\n\n**Suggestion 4: Figure and Table Improvements**\nWe will implement this suggestion as described in our response to Weakness 4.\n\n**Suggestion 5: Methodology Section**\nWe will implement this suggestion as described in our response to Weakness 5.\n\n**Suggestion 6: Broader Impact Section**\nWe will implement this suggestion as described in our response to Weakness 6. We will also add an ablation study to analyze the impact of different feedback noise levels on the continual learning process."
