  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel application of continual learning from human feedback in extractive QA, demonstrating performance gains in a deployed system. The paper's strengths lie in its clear presentation of the iterative approach and its differentiation from RLHF methods, but it is weakened by a lack of rigorous comparative evidence and insufficient ethical considerations.",
