  "summary": "This paper introduces SUBSUMM, a framework for opinion summarization designed to handle large review sets and multi-perspective summarization. The framework demonstrates superior performance compared to other supervised methods and shows user preference over ChatGPT, but the paper lacks sufficient detail in several areas, particularly regarding comparisons to existing baselines and ethical considerations.",
