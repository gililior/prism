    "rebuttal": "We thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time taken to carefully review our work and provide constructive criticism. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Data Privacy, Consent, and Usage Terms:** The reviewer raises concerns about data privacy, consent, and usage terms. We acknowledge this is a critical aspect of dataset creation. While we did not explicitly detail these aspects in the current version, we address this in the Ethics Statement. We will expand this section in the revised version to include more specific information on the source dataset's licensing (Schuster et al., 2021), which is permissively licensed, and clarify that our annotations are for research purposes only. We will also add a statement about the lack of personally identifiable information in the dataset.\n\n*   **Lack of Experimental Evidence for Language Model Training:** The reviewer points out the lack of experimental evidence for training language models with HTL. This is a valid point. As stated in Section 4, this is a conjecture and future work. We will revise the text to clearly state that this is a future research direction and will not overstate our claims. We will also add a sentence to the discussion section to clarify that we are aware of the need for experimental validation.\n\n*   **Ambiguity of 'Intuitive Theories':** The reviewer notes the potential ambiguity of the term 'intuitive theories.' We will address this by providing a concise definition of 'intuitive theories' in Section 1, referencing Tenenbaum et al. (2007) for further context. This will clarify our usage of the term and reduce potential ambiguity.\n\n*   **Lack of Notation Explanation:** The reviewer highlights the lack of a dedicated notation section. We agree that this could hinder understanding. We will add a dedicated section or a table explaining the notation used, particularly for Hoare triples, in the revised version. This will improve clarity, especially in Figures 1 and 2.\n\n*   **Limited Comparison with Existing Datasets:** The reviewer suggests a more detailed comparison with existing datasets. We will expand the Related Work section to include a more detailed comparison of HTL with existing datasets and methods in program understanding, highlighting the unique aspects of our approach and the specific advantages of HTL.\n\n*   **Insufficient Details on Annotation Protocol and Tool:** The reviewer requests more details on the annotation protocol and tool. We will expand Section 2 to provide a more detailed description of the annotation protocol, including inter-annotator agreement (if available) and examples of challenging cases. We will also provide more details on the tool's functionality.\n\n*   **Lack of Detail in Figure 3:** The reviewer requests clarification of the annotation coverage in Figure 3. We will revise Figure 3 to clarify what the annotation coverage represents and provide labels for the axes.\n\n*   **Missing Statistical Information in Table 1:** The reviewer points out the missing standard deviation in Table 1. We will include standard deviation and other descriptive statistics to provide a more complete picture of the data distribution in Table 1.\n\n*   **Lack of Discussion on Biases and Misuse:** The reviewer raises concerns about potential biases and misuse. We will add a section on potential biases in the dataset and the annotation process, as well as a discussion of potential misuse cases and mitigation strategies, in the revised version.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Experiments for Language Model Training:** We acknowledge the suggestion to conduct experiments. As stated above, this is planned future work. We will clearly indicate this in the revised version.\n\n*   **Definition of 'Intuitive Theories':** We will address this by providing a concise definition in Section 1, as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Notation Table:** We will include a notation table, as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Comparative Evaluation:** We will expand the Related Work section, as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Detailed Annotation Protocol:** We will expand Section 2, as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Limitations Discussion:** We will add a discussion of potential limitations, as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Figure 3 Clarification:** We will revise Figure 3, as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Table 1 Enhancement:** We will enhance Table 1, as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Bias and Misuse Section:** We will add a section on biases and misuse, as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Experiments Comparing Performance:** This is a valuable suggestion. We will consider this for future work, after we have conducted the initial experiments on language model training.\n\nWe believe that addressing these points will significantly improve the clarity, completeness, and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
