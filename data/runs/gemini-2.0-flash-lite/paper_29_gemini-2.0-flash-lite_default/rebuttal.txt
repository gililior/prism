    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time taken to carefully review our paper and provide constructive criticism. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Overclaiming Generalizability:** The reviewer points out that our generalizability claims are limited to relation extraction. We acknowledge this limitation. The conclusion (Section 4) explicitly states, \"Our effectiveness is only examined on the task of relation extraction... whether this method is able to generalize to other information extraction tasks, such as named entity recognition (NER) and event detection (ED), is not yet explored in this paper.\" We will address this in future work by conducting experiments on NER and ED tasks.\n\n*   **Insufficient Details on Causal Effects:** The reviewer requests more detail on the causal effects. We believe that Section 2.2 and Figure 3 provide a good overview. We will clarify the meaning of the causal effects in the next version by adding axis labels and units to Figure 3, as suggested. We will also provide a more detailed explanation of the variables (S, E, L, X, Y) in the SCM, including their specific roles and how they are derived, in Section 2.1.\n\n*   **Lack of Detailed Comparison with Prior Work:** We respectfully disagree. Section B (Related Work) provides a comprehensive overview of relevant prior work, including data-based, algorithm-based, and metric-based few-shot learning methods, as well as domain adaptation techniques. We also compare our approach with LPD (Zhang and Lu, 2022), which is the closest baseline, in Section 3.2 and Table 1, highlighting the performance difference. We will further clarify the specific improvement over the closest baseline in the revised version.\n\n*   **Figure 3 Clarity:** We agree that Figure 3 can be improved. We will add axis labels and units to clarify the meaning of the causal effects and consider adding a legend, as suggested.\n\n*   **Definition of 'C' and Causal Operations:** The reviewer appears to have overlooked the explanation of 'C'. In Section 2.1, we define 'C' as \"the contextualized representations of an input text, which is output by the pretrain BERT encoder.\" We will expand on the 'causal operations' mentioned in the abstract and section 2.2, explaining how intervention, counterfactual generation, prompt generation, dynamic weighting, and loss function design are implemented.\n\n*   **Privacy, Consent, and Ethical Risks:** We acknowledge the lack of discussion on these aspects. We will add a section in the appendix to address data collection, consent procedures, privacy measures, and terms of use for the datasets. We will also address the potential for bias in the datasets and how the model mitigates it.\n\n*   **Lack of Statistical Significance:** We will include standard deviations or confidence intervals for all reported accuracy values and add p-values to indicate statistical significance of performance differences in the revised version.\n\n*   **Bias and Societal Impacts:** We will add a section discussing potential misuse cases and mitigation strategies in the revised version.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Experiments on NER, ED:** We agree and will conduct experiments on these tasks.\n\n*   **Detailed Explanation of Causal Model:** We will provide a more detailed explanation of the variables and causal operations.\n\n*   **Head-to-Head Comparison:** We believe we already provide this in Section 3.2 and Table 1, but we will clarify the performance difference further.\n\n*   **Figure 3 Improvement:** We will implement the suggested improvements.\n\n*   **Detailed Explanation of Variables:** We will provide a more detailed explanation of the variables.\n\n*   **Expand on Causal Operations:** We will expand on the causal operations.\n\n*   **Notation Table:** We will add a notation table.\n\n*   **Data Collection Details:** We will add the requested details in the appendix.\n\n*   **Bias Mitigation:** We will address potential biases.\n\n*   **Statistical Significance:** We will include statistical significance.\n\n*   **Misuse Cases:** We will add a section on potential misuse.\n\n*   **Comparison with Zeng et al. (2020):** We will consider adding this comparison.\n\n*   **Comparison with Yamada et al. (2020) and Cong et al. (2021):** We will consider adding this comparison.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
