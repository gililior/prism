      "paper_topic_and_main_contributions": "This paper focuses on the cross-domain few-shot RE task from causal perspective. The authors propose a novel framework CausalGF based on structural causal model. The structural graph provides a theoretical explanation of feature selection and fusion for classification. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms baseline models on two benchmark datasets of this task.",
      "reasons_to_accept": "This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework for classification feature selection and fusion, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",
      "reasons_to_reject": "The motivation of graph topology selection is not well presented. See details in the first question in \u201cQuestion For The Authors\u201d.",
      "questions_for_the_authors": "1. In Figure 1, the edge from C to X is blocked and the counterfactual S* and E* are connected to X. However, it\u2019s easy to observe another alternative, which blocks the edge from C to Y and connects S* and E* to Y. The resulting graph will be like S*, E*, L, X connected to Y and C connected to X. In the prompt encoding step, h_S and h_E will be separately weighted and contribute to the total causal effect, which is different to the proposed method. Here\u2019s my question: why are you choosing the graph described in the paper instead of the above alternative? Is concatenating h_S and h_E better than separating them? If yes, would you please explain the reason? \n2. Is this approach capable of migrating to regular cross-domain RE task? \n3. In Figure 2, training on source domain is using S* and E*, but they are not used in inference. I don\u2019t think S* and E* include label information, so would you please explain the reason or point out if I am missing some information?",

      "paper_topic_and_main_contributions": "Previous work has mainly focused on transferring knowledge between domains through shared feature representations without analyzing the impact of each factor that may produce databases based on the characteristics of each domain. In this paper, the authors proposed a new framework CausalGF which is the first work analyzing data bias and the influence of various factors from a causal perspective in cross-domain few-shot RE tasks. The CausalGF outperforms previous SOTA methods in all scenarios.",
