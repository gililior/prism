  "summary": "This paper introduces a new dataset and approach for generating clarification questions to address ambiguity in questions. The paper demonstrates the stability of the proposed approach through detailed analysis, but the evaluation lacks sufficient statistical rigor and clarity. The paper would benefit from improved clarity, more comprehensive statistical analysis, and a discussion of potential societal impacts.",
