    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback, which has helped us identify areas for improvement in our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of detail on zero-shot classification approach:** We believe the reviewer may have overlooked the detailed explanation of our zero-shot classification approach. Section 4, specifically the \"Zero-shot classification\" subsection, describes how we use the generated potential intents as labels for a zero-shot BERT-based classifier implemented using NLI. We use sentence embedding vectors to define the scores (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019). We also refer to the work of Xian et al. (2018) and Yin et al. (2019) for the practical approach in problems where the set of candidate intents is known. We will consider expanding this section to further clarify the differences with existing methods.\n\n*   **Insufficient evidence for improvements and overclaiming generalizability:** We respectfully disagree with the assessment that we overclaim generalizability. We provide results across three languages (English, Italian, and German) and two datasets (SNLI and Banking77-OOS, with an NLI adaptation). Table 3 demonstrates the Z-BERT-A component improves results over most baselines in terms of accuracy in the known intent scenario. Tables 4, 5, and 6 show the performance of Z-BERT-A on the unknown intent discovery task. We acknowledge the lack of ablation studies. In the next version, we will include ablation studies to isolate the impact of the BERT-A module and other components.\n\n*   **Lack of information on data privacy, consent, usage terms, and ethical risks:** We acknowledge this is a critical omission. We will add a new section on \"Ethical Considerations and Data Privacy\" in the revised manuscript. This section will detail the data sources, licenses, consent procedures (where applicable), and privacy measures. We will also discuss potential ethical risks and mitigation strategies.\n\n*   **Lack of code/data link and information on variance:** We acknowledge this is a significant oversight. We will provide a link to a public code repository, including the code, data, and a requirements file. We will also specify the random seeds used for all experiments and report the variance of the results, as suggested. (Sections 4, 7)\n\n*   **Insufficient information on figures and tables:** We will improve the figures by adding axes labels, units, and clear descriptions of the elements. We will also include standard deviations or confidence intervals to show result variability in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5. We will also add p-values to indicate statistical significance of performance differences between models and datasets.\n\n*   **Lack of clear definition of 'intent' and 'novel intent':** We agree that clearer definitions are needed. We will add precise definitions of 'intent,' 'novel intent,' and 'utterance' early in the introduction (Section 1).\n\n*   **Lack of detailed explanation of dependency parsing and NLI components:** We believe the reviewer may have overlooked the detailed explanation of our dependency parsing and NLI components. Section 4 provides a detailed explanation of the dependency parsing and NLI components. We will consider expanding this section to further clarify the differences with existing methods.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Detailed comparison with existing zero-shot intent classification methods:** We believe the reviewer may have overlooked the detailed comparison with existing zero-shot intent classification methods. Section 2 provides a detailed comparison with existing zero-shot intent classification methods. We will consider expanding this section to further clarify the differences with existing methods.\n\n*   **Code repository, random seeds, and variance:** We will provide a link to a public code repository, including the code, data, and a requirements file. We will also specify the random seeds used for all experiments and report the variance of the results, as suggested.\n\n*   **Ablation studies and wider range of datasets:** We will include ablation studies to isolate the impact of the BERT-A module and other components of the proposed pipeline. We will also evaluate the approach on a wider range of datasets and tasks to demonstrate generalizability.\n\n*   **Data sources, licenses, consent, privacy, and ethical risks:** We will add a new section on \"Ethical Considerations and Data Privacy\" in the revised manuscript. This section will detail the data sources, licenses, consent procedures (where applicable), and privacy measures. We will also discuss potential ethical risks and mitigation strategies.\n\n*   **Figure and table details:** We will improve the figures by adding axes labels, units, and clear descriptions of the elements. We will also include standard deviations or confidence intervals to show result variability in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5. We will also add p-values to indicate statistical significance of performance differences between models and datasets.\n\n*   **Definitions and explanation of NLI and Adapters:** We will add precise definitions of 'intent,' 'novel intent,' and 'utterance' early in the introduction (Section 1). We will also provide a more detailed explanation of the NLI fine-tuning process and the role of Adapters.\n\n*   **Table of notation:** We will include a table of notation to clarify the symbols used in the equations and the overall methodology.\n\nWe are confident that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
