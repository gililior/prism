    "rebuttal": "We thank the reviewer for their insightful and thorough feedback. We appreciate the time taken to review our work and provide constructive criticism. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of comparison to existing methods:** We respectfully disagree that the paper lacks a clear comparison to existing methods. Section 2.2, \"Term Frequency and Model Behaviors,\" and Section 2.3, \"Spurious Features,\" extensively discuss related work on term frequency effects and spurious correlations in LLMs. We acknowledge that we could strengthen the comparison by including a quantitative comparison with existing debiasing techniques. We will add a paragraph in Section 6, \"Mitigation,\" comparing our debiasing approach with other methods, such as those that focus on adversarial training or data augmentation, and discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages.\n\n*   **Imprecise definition of 'co-occurrence statistics':** The reviewer is correct that the initial definition could be more precise. We partially address this in Section 4.1, \"Co-occurrence Statistics,\" where we describe our method for calculating co-occurrence. However, to clarify further, we will explicitly state the measure used (co-occurrence count within the same document) and provide a more detailed explanation of the text normalization process, including tokenization based on Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and stopword removal. We will also clarify that we use a document-level co-occurrence count due to computational constraints.\n\n*   **Lack of a dedicated notation section:** We acknowledge this omission. To improve clarity, we will add a \"Notation\" section in the revised manuscript. This section will define all key symbols and variables, including P pretrain ( obj | subj ) and other relevant notations used in our analysis.\n\n*   **Unclear figure labels and visual design:** We acknowledge this weakness. We will revise Figures 10 and 11 (and all other figures) to include clear axis labels with units and a comprehensive legend. We will also improve the overall visual design for better readability.\n\n*   **Lack of discussion on misuse cases, fairness, and societal impacts:** We acknowledge this is a critical area. We will add a new section to the revised manuscript, \"Ethical Considerations and Societal Impact,\" to address potential misuse scenarios, fairness considerations (e.g., biases in the pre-training data), and the broader societal impacts of our work. We will discuss how our findings relate to the responsible development and deployment of LLMs.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Quantitative comparison with existing debiasing techniques:** As mentioned above, we will incorporate a quantitative comparison with existing debiasing techniques in Section 6, \"Mitigation.\"\n\n*   **Detailed explanation of co-occurrence calculation:** We will provide a more detailed explanation of the co-occurrence calculation, including the specific formula or method used, in Section 4.1, as described above.\n\n*   **Table of notation:** We will include a table of notation in the revised manuscript, as described above.\n\n*   **Add axis labels and legends to figures:** We will revise all figures to include clear axis labels with units and a comprehensive legend, as described above.\n\n*   **Include a section on potential misuse scenarios, fairness considerations, and broader societal impacts:** We will add a new section to the revised manuscript, \"Ethical Considerations and Societal Impact,\" as described above.\n\nWe believe these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
