  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel causal intervention technique to mitigate entity bias in both white-box and black-box LLMs. The paper demonstrates the potential of this approach but lacks sufficient comparative analysis and clarity in several areas. Addressing the identified weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements will significantly strengthen the paper.",
