    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the effort taken to thoroughly assess our work. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of detailed comparison with relevant prior work:** We respectfully disagree. Our paper *does* include a detailed comparison with relevant prior work, particularly in Section 2 (Related Work) and Section 3.1 (Causal Analysis of Entity Bias). We analyze existing methods, including those using causal interventions, and highlight their limitations. We then position our SCM and intervention techniques as improvements. The reviewer may have overlooked this comparative analysis. We will strengthen the discussion in the revised version by explicitly tabulating the differences between our approach and the most relevant baselines, emphasizing the novelty of our SCM and the practical advantages of our intervention strategies.\n\n*   **Lack of computational resource details and random seeds:** The reviewer is correct; we did not explicitly state the computational resources and random seeds. We will add this information to Sections 4.1 and 5.1, including the specific GPU used (NVIDIA RTX A5000) and the random seeds used for all experiments to enhance reproducibility. We will also include a sentence in the Appendix mentioning that we will release the code.\n\n*   **Lack of confidence intervals or p-values:** We acknowledge this omission. We will include standard deviations in Table 1, which are already present, and will add p-values to indicate statistical significance. We will calculate these using appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) to compare our method with the baselines.\n\n*   **Lack of a dedicated societal impact section:** We acknowledge this important omission. We will add a dedicated section on societal impact, including potential risks, misuse cases, fairness considerations, and limitations of our approach. This will address the reviewer's concerns about insufficient evidence.\n\n*   **Unlabeled axes in Figure 5:** The reviewer is correct. We will label the axes in Figure 5 clearly and include a legend to improve clarity.\n\n*   **Lack of precise definition for \"neighboring entities\":** The term \"neighboring entities\" is defined in Section 3.2. We find the top k nearest neighbors according to embedding distance. We will clarify this definition in the abstract and provide a more detailed explanation of the selection process in Section 3.2, including the use of Euclidean distance in the embedding space.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Quantitative comparison with a state-of-the-art method:** We already compare our method with several state-of-the-art baselines, including Entity Substitution, CoRE, and Continual Pretraining, as shown in Table 1. We will consider adding a more recent state-of-the-art method if applicable. We will also add a table explicitly comparing our method with the most relevant baseline, highlighting the advantages of our approach.\n\n*   **Details on \"neighboring entities\" selection:** As mentioned above, we will provide more details on the selection of \"neighboring entities\" in Section 3.2, including the use of Euclidean distance in the embedding space.\n\n*   **Include random seeds and computational resources:** We will add this information to Sections 4 and 5, as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Provide a link to the code repository:** We plan to release the code and will include a link in the final version.\n\n*   **Include p-values or other statistical significance indicators:** We will add p-values to Table 1, as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Detailed section on dataset licensing, consent, and privacy:** We will add a section on dataset licensing, consent, and privacy in the revised version.\n\n*   **Label axes and include a legend for Figure 5:** We will revise Figure 5 as suggested.\n\n*   **More detailed explanation of the SCM and criteria for identifying \"similar entities\":** We will expand the explanation of the SCM in Section 3.1 and clarify the criteria for identifying \"similar entities\" in Section 3.2, as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Elaborate on the practical implications of the \"in-context intervention\":** We will elaborate on the practical implications of the \"in-context intervention\" for black-box LLMs in Section 3.3, discussing its advantages and potential applications.\n\n*   **Include a section discussing potential misuse, fairness concerns, and limitations:** We will add a section discussing potential misuse, fairness concerns, and limitations of the approach, as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Conduct an experiment comparing the proposed causal intervention method with a relevant baseline:** We already compare our method with several baselines on the same tasks, datasets, and evaluation metrics, as shown in Table 1. We will consider adding a more recent state-of-the-art method if applicable.\n\n*   **Include an ablation study to analyze the impact of different intervention strategies:** We already include an ablation study on the impact of different values of k in Section 4.3 (Effect of k). We will consider adding additional ablation studies in the revised version."
