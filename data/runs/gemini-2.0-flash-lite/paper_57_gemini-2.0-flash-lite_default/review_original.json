  "summary": "This paper introduces ReXMiner, a novel approach for zero-shot relation extraction in web mining, leveraging relative XML paths and node popularity. ReXMiner demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the SWDE dataset. However, the paper lacks detailed comparisons with relevant baselines and requires more rigorous analysis and reporting to fully validate its claims.",
