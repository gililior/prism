    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback, which has helped us identify areas for improvement in our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of detailed comparison with relevant baselines:** We respectfully disagree. Our paper *does* compare ReXMiner with relevant baselines, including ZeroshotCeres, a state-of-the-art method for zero-shot relation extraction on web pages. We provide detailed results and analysis in Section 5.4 and Table 2, where we directly compare ReXMiner's performance against ZeroshotCeres and the Colon Baseline. We believe the reviewer may have overlooked this comparison. We will clarify this further in the revised version by explicitly highlighting the comparison with ZeroshotCeres in the introduction and abstract.\n\n*   **Limited analysis of performance variation and insufficient ablation studies:** We acknowledge that the analysis of performance variation could be expanded. While we present an ablation study in Section 5.5 and Table 3, demonstrating the contribution of each component, we will enhance this in the revised version. We will add a more in-depth discussion of the performance variations across different verticals in Section 5.4, including a brief analysis of the factors that might contribute to these differences. We will also add a more detailed analysis of the impact of each feature in the ablation study.\n\n*   **Missing variance and random seeds:** We acknowledge this omission. We will address this in the revised version by reporting the standard deviation of the F1-scores in Tables 2, 3, and 5. We will also specify the random seeds used for the experiments in Section 5.2.\n\n*   **Missing experimental environment information:** We acknowledge this omission. We will include details about the hardware and software environment used for the experiments in Appendix A, including the specific libraries and their versions. We will also consider providing a Dockerfile to facilitate reproducibility.\n\n*   **Missing labels in Figures and Table 1, and missing standard deviations in Tables 2, 3, and 5:** We acknowledge the need for improvement. We will add labels to the different layers and components of the ReXMiner framework in Figures 3 and 4. We will also add standard deviations to Tables 2, 3, and 5. Table 1 already contains the statistics of the SWDE dataset. We will clarify this in the revised version.\n\n*   **Lack of clear definition of \"relative XML Path\":** We acknowledge this omission. We will provide a concise definition of \"relative XML Path\" with a visual example in the introduction and Section 4.3.\n\n*   **Lack of dedicated methodology section:** We acknowledge this omission. We will create a dedicated methodology section (Section 4) to elaborate on the ReXMiner architecture, including a more detailed explanation of each component.\n\n*   **Lack of discussion of potential biases, risks, and broader societal impacts:** We acknowledge this omission. We will add a section (Section 8) discussing the potential biases, risks, and broader societal impacts of our work.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Head-to-head comparison with a state-of-the-art method:** As mentioned above, we *already* perform a head-to-head comparison with ZeroshotCeres in Section 5.4 and Table 2. We will clarify this in the revised version.\n\n*   **Include ablation studies:** We *already* include ablation studies in Section 5.5 and Table 3. We will expand on these studies as mentioned above.\n\n*   **Provide code and data:** We plan to release our code publicly, as stated in the Ethics Statement (Section 8). We will provide the code and data used for the experiments, including a requirements.txt file, upon publication.\n\n*   **Specify random seeds and report variance:** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Provide details about the experimental environment:** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Add labels to Figures 3 and 4:** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Include standard deviations or confidence intervals:** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Provide a concise definition of \"relative XML Path\":** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Create a dedicated methodology section:** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Include a discussion of potential biases, risks, and broader societal impacts:** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Conduct experiments comparing ReXMiner with a BERT-based model:** We believe that comparing with a BERT-based model would not provide significant new insights, as our approach builds upon MarkupLM, which itself is based on a Transformer architecture. We will, however, consider adding a brief discussion of this point in the related work section.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
