  "summary": "This paper introduces ReXMiner, a novel approach for zero-shot relation extraction in web mining, leveraging relative XML paths and node popularity. ReXMiner demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the SWDE dataset. The authors have addressed some of the initial weaknesses by clarifying existing content and promising future improvements. However, the paper still requires more rigorous analysis and reporting to fully validate its claims.",
