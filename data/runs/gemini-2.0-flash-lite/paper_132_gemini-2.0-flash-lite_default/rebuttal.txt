    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of experimental setting details (Section 5):** We believe the reviewer may have overlooked the extensive details provided in Section 5.1, which explicitly outlines the datasets (MS MARCO and Natural Questions), baselines (sparse, dense with brute force, and dense with ANN indexes), and implementation details. We will enhance this section by adding a more comprehensive table summarizing the key experimental settings for clarity.\n\n*   **Lack of comparison with existing hybrid retrieval methods:** The reviewer is correct that we don't directly compare with other hybrid retrieval methods. However, our work focuses on accelerating *dense* retrieval. While we acknowledge the complementary nature of hybrid approaches, our core contribution lies in optimizing the ANN index for dense retrieval. We will add a paragraph in the related work to clarify this distinction and explain why a direct comparison is not the primary focus. We will also add a sentence to the conclusion to highlight this point.\n\n*   **Insufficient detail on neural network implementation (Sec 3.2):** We acknowledge that Section 4.2 could benefit from more specifics. We will expand this section to include the architecture of the MLP used in the term selector (two-layer MLP with ReLU activation), and training details such as the optimizer, learning rate, and batch size. We will also clarify the role of BERT in the term selector.\n\n*   **Lack of definition of 'salient terms':** We respectfully disagree. The definition of salient terms is provided in Section 4.2, where we explain that salient terms are identified using BM25 (for HIunsup) and BERT (for HIsup). We will clarify this further by explicitly stating that salient terms are those with high BM25 scores or high BERT attention weights.\n\n*   **Missing axis labels and unclear legends (Figures 1, 3, 4):** We acknowledge this weakness. We will revise Figures 1, 3, and 4 to include clear axis labels with units (e.g., recall, latency in ms) and comprehensive legends to distinguish between methods. We will also consider using different markers and line styles to improve readability.\n\n*   **Dataset privacy and consent:** We acknowledge this omission. We will add a section addressing dataset licenses and usage terms. Since the datasets (MS MARCO and Natural Questions) are publicly available, we will cite their sources and licenses. We will also include a statement about our adherence to the datasets' terms of use.\n\n*   **Lack of p-values, confidence intervals, and standard deviations (Table 1):** We acknowledge this weakness. We will include p-values, confidence intervals, and standard deviations in Tables 1, 2, and 3 to provide a more rigorous statistical analysis of our results.\n\n*   **Lack of comparison with [1] and [2]:** We respectfully disagree. While we cite [1] and [2] in our related work, a direct comparison is not the focus of our work. Our work focuses on improving ANN indexes for dense retrieval, while [1] and [2] focus on different aspects of dense retrieval. We will add a sentence to the related work to clarify this point.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **More details on experimental setup (Section 5):** We believe this is already addressed in Section 5.1, as mentioned above. We will enhance this section for clarity.\n\n*   **Head-to-head comparison with a hybrid retrieval method:** As stated above, our focus is on improving ANN indexes for dense retrieval, not on directly competing with hybrid methods. We will clarify this in the related work.\n\n*   **Ablation studies:** We already provide ablation studies in Section 5.3, analyzing the contribution of the cluster and term selectors. We will enhance this section for clarity.\n\n*   **Axis labels and legends (Figures 1, 3, 4):** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **P-values, confidence intervals, and standard deviations (Tables 1, 2, and 3):** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Address consent and privacy:** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Ablation study to isolate the impact of the hybrid index:** We believe that the ablation study in Section 5.3 already addresses this point. We will clarify this in the revised manuscript."
