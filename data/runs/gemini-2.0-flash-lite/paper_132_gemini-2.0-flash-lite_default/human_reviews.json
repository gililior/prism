      "paper_topic_and_main_contributions": "This paper studied the problem of dense retrieval. It aims at improving the document embedding for clustering as well as accelerate the retrieval process. To this end, the authors proposed a hybrid inverted index which combines the advantage of dense retrieval and lexical matching. The authors also proposed learning techniques for term and cluster selection with a joint optimization solution. Experiments are conducted on several popular datasets and the results look promising.",
      "reasons_to_accept": "- The research topic is important.\n- The paper is well written.\n- The proposed techniques are solid.",
      "reasons_to_reject": "- Some latest related works from the field of high dimensional similarity search are ignored such as [1]. They have been proved to have better performance than graph based methods such as HNSW compared here.\n- The comparison with some inverted list based sparse retrieval methods are missing. There are some works about compression over inverted lists and perfrom similarity search on them such as [2] [3]. They could also be extended as baseline methods. Since they are optimized, they should perform better than the selected sparse method here.\n- There is no result about space overhead.",

The approach includes a score function and a strategy to optimize lexical and semantic \"words\" selection.",
