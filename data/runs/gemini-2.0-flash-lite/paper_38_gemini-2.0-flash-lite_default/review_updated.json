  "summary": "This paper introduces CACAO, a novel two-stage approach for Open-Vocabulary NER, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. The authors have addressed some of the initial concerns regarding clarity and reproducibility, but further improvements are needed, particularly regarding the analysis of performance differences and the inclusion of a discussion on potential biases and misuse cases.",
