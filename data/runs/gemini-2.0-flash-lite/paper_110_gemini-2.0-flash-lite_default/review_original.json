  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel Generative Spoken Language Model (GSLM) using continuous word-size embeddings, achieving comparable performance to discrete unit-based models while being more memory efficient. However, the paper lacks clarity in defining key components like the \"Lexical Embedder\" and requires more rigorous comparisons and statistical analysis to fully support its claims.",
