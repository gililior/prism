  "summary": "This paper introduces AutoTrial, a novel approach leveraging LLMs for automating clinical trial design. The paper demonstrates promising results in generating clinical trial criteria, but the lack of detail on baselines, implementation specifics, and ethical considerations still limits the assessment of its overall impact, although the authors have clarified some aspects in their rebuttal.",
