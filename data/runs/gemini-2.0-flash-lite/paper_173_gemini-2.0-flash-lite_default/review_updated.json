  "summary": "This paper introduces KAPALM, a novel method for fake news detection that integrates coarse- and fine-grained knowledge representations. The model demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines, but the paper lacks crucial details regarding experimental setup, statistical significance, and ethical considerations. The authors have addressed some of the weaknesses in their rebuttal, including clarifying the pruning strategy, providing more details on the GNN architecture, and promising to include statistical information and an ethical considerations section. However, some weaknesses remain due to the lack of concrete changes in the current version.",
