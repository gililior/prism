  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel Co-Training and Co-Distillation (CTCD) framework for knowledge distillation, aiming to improve model performance and inference speed. The paper demonstrates performance gains on the GLUE benchmark and provides detailed implementation information. The authors have addressed several weaknesses raised in the initial review, including clarifying the novelty of the approach, providing statistical information, and clarifying the relationship between CTCD and Community KD. The authors also commit to including random seeds, variance information, and a code repository. Further experiments comparing CTCD with TinyBERT and an ablation study are planned.",
