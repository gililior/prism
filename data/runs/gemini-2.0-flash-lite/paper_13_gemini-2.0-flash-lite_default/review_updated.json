  "summary": "This paper introduces MEMECAP, a novel dataset for meme captioning, addressing the challenge of understanding visual metaphors in memes. The paper presents a new dataset and experimental setup. The authors have addressed some of the weaknesses raised in the initial review, including clarifying the evaluation metrics and addressing licensing concerns. However, the paper still lacks crucial details regarding experimental variance and comparative analysis with existing methods, though the authors have acknowledged these limitations and plan to address them in future work.",
