    "rebuttal": "We thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the opportunity to clarify our work and address the concerns raised.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Reproducibility (Lack of seeds, environment, variance):** The reviewer points out the lack of information for reproducibility. We acknowledge this is a critical aspect. \n    *   *Addressing:* We have included the model name and parameters used in the experiments. (Section 3 and its subsections). We will include the random seeds used in the experiments in the next version of the paper. We will also include the hardware and software environment details used for the experiments. We will add standard deviations to the tables. (Tables 2, 3, and 4).\n\n*   **Algorithm and Ontology Explanation:** The reviewer finds the algorithm's inner workings and ontology explanation unclear. \n    *   *Addressing:* We believe the core algorithm, CES, is described in Section 2, with a graphical representation in Figure 1. The generation of conceptual spaces, including the use of the Wikipedia category graph as an ontology, is detailed in Section 2.1. We will revise the introduction and related work sections to better highlight the novelty of our approach and its differences from existing methods.\n\n*   **Comparative Evidence:** The reviewer requests more direct comparisons with existing LLM embedding interpretation methods. \n    *   *Addressing:* We respectfully disagree that the paper lacks comparative evidence. We compare our method with DMA words and DMA concepts in Section 3.3.2 and with the true labels in Section D. We will expand the discussion of related work (Section 5) to include a more detailed comparison with the methods mentioned by the reviewer and others, quantifying performance differences where possible. We will also add a quantitative comparison with existing methods on shared datasets.\n\n*   **Table Descriptions and Statistical Significance:** The reviewer notes the lack of detailed descriptions of metrics and statistical significance measures in the tables. \n    *   *Addressing:* We acknowledge this limitation. We will add standard deviations, confidence intervals, and descriptive labels to Tables 2, 3, and 4 to improve clarity and statistical rigor.\n\n*   **Ethical Considerations:** The reviewer raises concerns about dataset licensing, consent, privacy, potential biases, and misuse. \n    *   *Addressing:* We will add an Ethics Statement section to the paper, explicitly addressing these concerns. We will discuss potential biases in the datasets and the model, and we will outline mitigation strategies.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Provide Code, Data, Seeds, and Variance Information:** We will provide code, data, random seeds, and variance information to ensure reproducibility, as stated above.\n\n*   **Specify Hardware/Software and Consider Docker:** We will specify the hardware and software environment used for the experiments and consider using a tool like Docker for reproducibility.\n\n*   **Detailed Comparison with Existing Methods:** We will expand the related work section and include quantitative comparisons with existing methods on shared datasets.\n\n*   **In-depth Algorithm Explanation:** We believe the algorithm is explained in Section 2. We will revise the introduction and related work sections to better highlight the novelty of our approach and its differences from existing methods. We will add a discussion of the algorithm's computational complexity and limitations.\n\n*   **Include Standard Deviations, Confidence Intervals, and Descriptive Labels:** We will add standard deviations, confidence intervals, and descriptive labels to Tables 2, 3, and 4.\n\n*   **Address Ethical Considerations:** We will add an Ethics Statement section to the paper.\n\n*   **Quantitative Comparisons with Existing Methods:** We will conduct quantitative comparisons with existing methods on shared datasets.\n\nWe believe these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our work. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
