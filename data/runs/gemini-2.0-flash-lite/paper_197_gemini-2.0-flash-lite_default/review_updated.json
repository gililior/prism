  "summary": "This paper proposes MProto, a novel method for Distant Supervision Named Entity Recognition (DS-NER) that utilizes multiple prototypes and the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm to address intra-class variance and incomplete labeling. The paper demonstrates improved robustness to incomplete labeling noise compared to baseline methods. The authors have addressed some of the weaknesses raised in the initial review, including clarifying SOTA comparisons and providing more details on reproducibility. However, the paper still needs to address the lack of detailed comparisons to state-of-the-art methods and provide more detailed analyses to fully support its claims. The authors have promised to address other weaknesses in the revised version.",
