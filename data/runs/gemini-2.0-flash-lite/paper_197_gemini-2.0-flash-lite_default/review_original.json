  "summary": "This paper proposes MProto, a novel method for Distant Supervision Named Entity Recognition (DS-NER) that utilizes multiple prototypes and the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm to address intra-class variance and incomplete labeling. While the paper demonstrates promising results, particularly in robustness to noise, it lacks sufficient comparisons to state-of-the-art methods and detailed analyses to fully support its claims.",
