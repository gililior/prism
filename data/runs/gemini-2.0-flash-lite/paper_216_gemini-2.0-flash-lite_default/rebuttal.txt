    "rebuttal": "We thank the reviewer for their thorough and constructive feedback. We address each point below:\n\n**Weakness 1: Overclaiming Generalizability and Distinguishing from Baseline**\nWe respectfully disagree that the paper overclaims generalizability. We believe the SCROLLS benchmark, encompassing diverse tasks, provides a strong test of generalizability. Our results on SCROLLS, where COLT5-XL achieves SOTA (Table 3), demonstrate strong performance across various tasks. We also provide results on TriviaQA, arXiv, and other datasets. We believe the consistent gains over LONGT5 across multiple datasets (Figure 2, Table 3) provide sufficient evidence to distinguish COLT5 from the baseline. We will clarify the scope of our claims in the conclusion to avoid any misinterpretations.\n\n**Weakness 2: Evidence for Routing Method and Ablation Studies**\nThe reviewer is correct that more detailed ablation studies would strengthen the paper. We partially address this concern in Section 4.5, where we ablate the routing mechanism (static routing, shared QKV routing, different numbers of routed tokens, and different attention settings). We will expand this section in the next version to include more detailed analyses of the routing mechanism's impact, including a more in-depth analysis of the routing patterns. We will also add a new ablation study comparing the performance of COLT5 with and without the heavy branches.\n\n**Weakness 3: Reproducibility and Ethical Concerns**\nWe acknowledge the need for improved reproducibility and address ethical concerns. We will add a section in the appendix detailing the random seeds used for all experiments. We will also include a `requirements.txt` file specifying the exact versions of all software dependencies. We will add explicit license and consent statements for the datasets used. We will add a discussion of potential biases in the training data and mitigation strategies in the Broader Impact section.\n\n**Weakness 4: Figure and Table Clarity**\nWe acknowledge the need for improved clarity in figures and tables. We will add axis labels, units, and legends to all figures (e.g., Figures 2, 4, 6). We will include standard deviations or confidence intervals for all reported metrics in tables (e.g., Tables 3, 7, 9). We will also review all figures and tables to ensure they are as clear and informative as possible.\n\n**Weakness 5: Addressing Biases, Misuse, and Environmental Impact**\nWe acknowledge the importance of addressing potential biases, misuse, and environmental impact. We will add a Broader Impact section to the conclusion, discussing potential biases in the training data, the potential for misuse, and mitigation strategies. We will also briefly address the environmental impact of training and deploying the model.\n\n**Suggestion 1: More Detailed Ablation Studies**\nWe agree with this suggestion and will expand the ablation studies as described above.\n\n**Suggestion 2: Specify and Document Random Seeds and Software Dependencies**\nWe will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n**Suggestion 3: Add Explicit License and Consent Statements and Discuss Potential Biases**\nWe will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n**Suggestion 4: Add Error Bars and Standard Deviations**\nWe will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n**Suggestion 5: Analyze Potential for Misuse and Propose Mitigation Strategies and Consider Environmental Impact**\nWe will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n**Suggestion 6: Add a Broader Impact Section**\nWe will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\nWe believe these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, reproducibility, and ethical considerations of our paper. We thank the reviewer again for their valuable feedback."
