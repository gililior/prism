    "rebuttal": "We thank the reviewer for their insightful and detailed feedback. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Claim of Disentanglement:** The reviewer states that the claim of POE disentangling the two jobs is an overstatement. We respectfully disagree. While we acknowledge that we do not provide *direct* evidence in the form of separate analyses of the elimination and prediction steps, the design of POE itself *is* the evidence. As shown in Figure 1 and Section 2, POE explicitly separates the elimination and prediction phases. The case study in Section B.2, particularly Figure 4, provides *indirect* evidence by showing how POE eliminates incorrect options in the first step, allowing it to correctly predict the answer in the second step, while MCP struggles. We will clarify this point in the revised version by explicitly stating that the two-step design *implies* disentanglement and that the case study provides supporting evidence.\n\n*   **Comparison to Closest Baselines:** The reviewer requests a more detailed comparison to baselines that might incorporate option filtering. We believe the paper *does* address this. Section 3 details the baselines used, including MCP, which is a strong baseline. Section 4 and Table 1 directly compare POE to these baselines, showing POE's performance relative to MCP and other scoring methods. We will clarify in the revised version that MCP serves as a strong baseline that implicitly incorporates a form of option ranking, and highlight the delta between POE and MCP more explicitly in the discussion.\n\n*   **Figure 3 Axis Labels:** The reviewer points out the lack of axis labels in Figure 3. This is a valid point. We will add clear axis labels and units to Figure 3 in the revised version.\n\n*   **Statistical Information in Tables:** The reviewer requests p-values or confidence intervals. We acknowledge this omission. We will include p-values or confidence intervals in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 5 in the revised version to support our claims of significant performance differences. Table 4, which provides task information, does not require performance metrics.\n\n*   **Ambiguity in Equation 5:** The reviewer finds Equation 5 ambiguous. The 'arg' was a typo, and we will replace it with the correct mathematical notation for the average (overline) and complete the sentence in the revised version. The sentence was cut off due to a formatting error.\n\n*   **Notation Table:** The reviewer suggests a notation table. We agree that this would improve readability. We will add a notation table in the appendix in the revised version.\n\n*   **Misuse, Fairness, and Societal Impacts:** The reviewer requests a discussion of potential misuse, fairness, and societal impacts. We acknowledge the importance of these considerations. We will add a dedicated section to the ethics statement in the revised version, discussing potential misuse cases, fairness considerations, and broader societal impacts.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Ablation Studies:** We agree that ablation studies would be beneficial. However, given the scope of the paper and the computational cost, we will prioritize the other revisions. We will consider this for future work.\n\n*   **Direct Comparison with Strong Scoring-Based Baseline:** We believe we already provide this comparison with MCP (Section 3, Table 1). We will clarify this in the revision.\n\n*   **Sensitivity Analysis of Threshold:** We will consider this for future work.\n\n*   **Error Bars in Figures:** We will add error bars to Figures 2 and 3 in the revised version.\n\n*   **P-values and Task Details in Tables:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Equation 5 and Notation Table:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Ethics Section:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Broader Societal Impacts:** Addressed above.\n\nWe believe these revisions will significantly improve the clarity and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
