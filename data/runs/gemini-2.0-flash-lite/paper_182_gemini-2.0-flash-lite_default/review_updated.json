  "summary": "This paper introduces POE, a novel two-step method for multiple-choice reasoning that demonstrates strong performance on several benchmarks. While POE achieves competitive results, the paper needs improvements in clarity and statistical rigor. The authors have addressed some concerns regarding clarity and statistical analysis in their rebuttal.",
