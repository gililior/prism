      "reasons_to_reject": "1. The description of the dataset is not specific enough, such as the domains, the average number of sentences of these articles, how many sentences are in the longest article, and how many sentences are in the shortest article. \n2. The data collection method, the annotation process lack of details, for example, what is the annotator agreement score? \n2. Do not describe the difference between their proposed method and Siamese networks. \n3. Do not clarify the difference between fake news detection, satirical news detection and clickbait detection. Maybe the author can explain it in the intro section.",
      "questions_for_the_authors": "A. (Line 200-202) Is this phenomenon announced by the website itself or by the author's study? If it is a study, please give an argument, otherwise I think this conclusion is a strong hypothesis lack of justification. \nB. The conclusion does not give insight and line332 mentioned that \"non-clickbait articles is fairly easy. However, clickbait articles are comparatively\",  is it possible that the data set is biased (4,460 non-clickbait samples and 3,453 clickbait samples)?",

They train and evaluate four models and an ensemble of these models to establish competitive baselines for future research on their corpus. The authors propose a novel approach using a BERT model based on contrastive learning, which leverages cosine similarity between the title and content to detect clickbait articles. The empirical results indicate significant potential for future research on the Romanian clickbait detection task. The availability of RoCliCo opens up opportunities for collaboration and advancement in clickbait detection methods for the Romanian language.",

This addition would provide readers with a deeper understanding of the study's theoretical foundations and the methodologies used to achieve the results.\n- To ascertain the significance of the reported results, the authors should provide statistical analysis.

      "reasons_to_reject": "The number and type of baseline models in the Experiments section are too few, only 4.  The size of RoCliCo is relatively small since the majority of non-clickbait samples can be collected from some authoritative news website.\nThough Cohen\u2019s kappa coefficient among annotators is 0.73, the labeling process lack of cross-check, which can introduce biases and errors in the labeling results.",

Were there any specific reasons for choosing these websites over others?\nHow did you ensure the quality and consistency of the annotations provided by the volunteers? Did you conduct any inter-annotator agreement analysis or provide any guidelines for the annotators?\nAs the clickbait detection task is quite similar to the natural language inference task (NLI), why do the authors not pick some existing NLI models for comparison?\nSection 3: In the last paragraph, \u201c\u2026 the test data represents a more natural distribution, \u2026\u201d, what is \u201cnatural distribution\u201d? Is imbalance data the same as \u201cnatural distribution\u201d?\nSection 4: In the 1st paragraph, \u201c\u2026 based on part-of-speech, scores, and punctuation patterns.\u201d, what do the scores represent?\nSection 4: In the 2nd paragraph, \u201cEach input is first preprocessed by a tokenizer.\u201d, which tokenizer do the authors employ? NLTK, Gensim, or StanfordCoreNLP?\nSection 4: In the 2nd paragraph, \u201cThe resulting embeddings are passed as input to the neural network.\u201d, what neural network is chosen? MLP, CNN, or Transformer?\nSection 4: In the 3rd paragraph, \u201cThe generated Ro-BERT-based embeddings are passed through a dropout layer, a fully-connected layer, and a classification layer.\u201d, as the former sentence mentioned [SEP], does here the embedding denote [CLS] embedding?",
