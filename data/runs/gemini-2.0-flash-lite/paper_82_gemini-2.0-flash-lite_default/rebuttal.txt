    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their insightful and detailed feedback, which has helped us to identify areas for improvement in our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Weakness 1: Lack of detailed comparison with existing state-of-the-art clickbait detection models.** We respectfully disagree with this assessment. While we acknowledge the importance of comparing with state-of-the-art models, the primary contribution of this paper is the introduction of a novel Romanian clickbait detection corpus (RoCliCo). As stated in the Introduction, \"To the best of our knowledge, RoCliCo is the first publicly available corpus for Romanian clickbait detection.\" Furthermore, the paper establishes competitive baselines for future research on this corpus. We believe that comparing with state-of-the-art models is beyond the scope of this initial work, but we will include this in future work. We will also include a comparison with a strong baseline model that uses a similar architecture on the RoCliCo dataset, and provide ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the contrastive learning approach.\n\n*   **Weakness 2: Insufficient information about the annotation process.** We believe the reviewer may have overlooked the detailed description of the annotation process in Section 3 (Corpus). We explicitly state that \"All data samples were labeled by annotators who received detailed instructions on the factors that should be taken into account when labeling news as clickbait or non-clickbait.\" We also describe the annotators' qualifications, the instructive document provided, and the criteria used for labeling. The Cohen's kappa coefficient (0.73) is provided to show inter-annotator agreement. We will clarify this further by adding a table summarizing the key characteristics of RoCliCo.\n\n*   **Weakness 3: Lack of addressing potential biases and dataset licensing.** We acknowledge this gap and will address it in the next version. We will add a Broader Impact section with mitigation strategies and include explicit license and consent statements for datasets used.\n\n*   **Weakness 4: Lack of seeds for random number generators and statistical information in Table 1.** We acknowledge the need for greater reproducibility and will address this in the next version. We will include the seeds used for all experiments and report the variance of the results. We will also include p-values or other statistical significance measures in Table 2, and consider adding a column for standard deviation or confidence intervals for the hyperparameter values in Tables 3 and 4.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Suggestion 1: Include a comparison with a strong baseline model and ablation studies.** As mentioned above, we will incorporate this suggestion in the next version.\n\n*   **Suggestion 2: Analyze dataset characteristics and provide error analysis.** We will add a table summarizing the key characteristics of RoCliCo. We will also provide a more detailed error analysis to understand the types of clickbait articles that the model struggles with.\n\n*   **Suggestion 3: Add explicit license and consent statements and include seeds.** We will incorporate this suggestion in the next version.\n\n*   **Suggestion 4: Include p-values and standard deviation.** We will incorporate this suggestion in the next version.\n\n*   **Suggestion 5: Add a Broader Impact section and a table summarizing RoCliCo.** We will incorporate this suggestion in the next version.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity and impact of our work. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
