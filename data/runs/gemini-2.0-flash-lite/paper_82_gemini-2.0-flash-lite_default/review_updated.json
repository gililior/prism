  "summary": "This paper introduces RoCliCo, a novel Romanian clickbait detection dataset, and proposes a BERT-based contrastive learning model. The model achieves strong performance on the new dataset, demonstrating the potential of contrastive learning for this task. The paper addresses some weaknesses by clarifying existing content, but still requires more detail on dataset characteristics and model behavior.",
