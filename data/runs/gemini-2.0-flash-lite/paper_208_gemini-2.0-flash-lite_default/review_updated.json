  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel approach for clinical predictive tasks using LLM-extracted features. The paper demonstrates comparable performance to reference high-level features, and highlights the interpretability of the model. The authors have addressed some concerns regarding interpretability, reproducibility, and ethical considerations in their rebuttal, but further improvements are needed.",
