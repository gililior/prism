  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel approach for clinical predictive tasks using LLM-extracted features. The paper demonstrates comparable performance to reference high-level features, and highlights the interpretability of the model. However, the paper needs to strengthen its claims regarding interpretability, address reproducibility concerns, and provide more detail on ethical considerations.",
