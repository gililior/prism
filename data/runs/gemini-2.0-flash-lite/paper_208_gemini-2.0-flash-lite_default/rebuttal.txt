    "rebuttal": "We thank the reviewer for their careful reading and insightful feedback. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Overclaiming Interpretability:** We acknowledge this concern. The reviewer is correct that features extracted by LLMs do not always guarantee interpretability and can sometimes simply restate the downstream task. We address this directly in Section 5 (Discussion), where we explicitly discuss the potential for queries to simply paraphrase the task and the need to design queries that elicit distinct, verifiable features. We believe the reviewer may have overlooked this section. We will strengthen this point in the revised version by adding a sentence emphasizing the importance of carefully crafting queries to avoid this pitfall.\n\n*   **Opacity of LLM Feature Extraction:** We agree with the reviewer. The opacity of the LLM-based feature extraction process is a key limitation, as we state in Section 6 (Conclusions) and the Ethics Statement. We acknowledge this limitation and discuss the need for further research into verifying the faithfulness of predicted features. We believe the reviewer has correctly identified a core limitation of our work.\n\n*   **Data Privacy, Bias, and Fairness:** The reviewer is correct that the paper lacks a dedicated section on data privacy, bias, and fairness. This is a significant omission. We will add a new section to the revised manuscript addressing data anonymization techniques, security measures, potential biases in EHR data, and their impact on model performance and fairness. We will also include a more detailed discussion of the ethical implications of our work, as suggested.\n\n*   **Lack of Seeds and Variance:** The reviewer is correct. We did not report the random seeds used for our experiments, nor did we discuss variance across runs. This hinders reproducibility. We will rectify this in the revised version by reporting the random seeds used for all experiments and providing the variance or confidence intervals of the results. This will be added to Section 3.3, Experimental Details.\n\n*   **Code and Data Availability:** The reviewer is correct. We did not explicitly state the availability of code or data. We will include a statement in the revised manuscript indicating that the code and data used in the experiments will be made available upon publication, including a requirements.txt file for environment setup. This will be added to the Abstract, Section 2, and Section 3.\n\n*   **Definition of 'Interpretable Features':** The reviewer is correct that the definition of 'interpretable features' could be clearer. We will add a concise definition of 'interpretable features' early in the Introduction (Section 1) to provide a clearer understanding of our terminology.\n\n*   **Notation Clarification:** The reviewer is correct. The notation in Equation 1 could be clarified. We will add a table of notation to define all symbols used in the equations, especially in the Methods section (Section 2).\n\n*   **Potential for Misuse:** The reviewer is correct that the paper does not explicitly discuss the potential for misuse of the model. We will add a paragraph to the Ethics Statement (Section 6) discussing the potential for misuse, such as discrimination against certain patient groups, and reiterate that the work is for scientific exploration only.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Head-to-Head Comparison:** We appreciate the suggestion. While we do not include a direct head-to-head comparison with a contemporaneous method, we compare our approach to several baselines, including Clinical BERT and TF-IDF, in Section 4.2 (Downstream classification performance) and Figure 4. We believe these comparisons provide a valuable context for evaluating our method. We will consider adding a more direct comparison in future work.\n\n*   **Trade-off Experiments and Feature Faithfulness:** We agree with the reviewer's suggestion to assess the trade-off between interpretability and predictive power when designing queries and to develop methods to verify the faithfulness of predicted features. This aligns with our discussion in Section 5 (Discussion) and our planned future work. We will explicitly state our intention to pursue this line of research in the revised version.\n\n*   **Code, Data, Seeds, and Variance:** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Data Privacy, Bias, and Fairness:** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Definition of 'Interpretable Features':** We will implement this suggestion as described above.\n\n*   **Table of Notation:** We will implement this suggestion as described above."
