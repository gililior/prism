    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Lack of detail on baselines:** The reviewer suggests a lack of detail on baselines. We respectfully disagree. Section 5.2 explicitly lists and categorizes the baselines used, including structure-based and semi-supervised methods. We believe the descriptions provided are sufficient for understanding the context. We will consider adding a brief summary of the key characteristics of each baseline in the revised version to further clarify their differences.\n\n*   **Lack of explicit experimental results:** The reviewer states that specific experimental results supporting the claim of MixTEA's effectiveness are not explicitly cited in the main text. We believe this is a misinterpretation. Section 5.3 and Table 1 present the core experimental results, directly demonstrating MixTEA's superior performance compared to the baselines. We will revise Section 5.3 to explicitly highlight the key results and their implications.\n\n*   **Hyperparameter analysis in the appendix:** The reviewer points out that hyperparameter analysis results are deferred to the appendix. This is correct. Due to space constraints, we placed the detailed analysis in Appendix D. We will include a concise summary of the key findings from Appendix D in Section 6.3 to improve accessibility.\n\n*   **Lack of implementation details:** The reviewer requests more implementation details. We believe the paper provides sufficient information. Section 4.1 details the KG encoder, and Section 4.2 describes the teacher-student architecture, including the EMA update and loss functions. We will clarify the architecture of the teacher and student models in Section 4.2 to avoid any confusion.\n\n*   **Variance and statistical significance:** The reviewer notes the lack of information on variance and statistical significance. This is a valid point. We will report the standard deviation for all results in Table 1 and include the random seeds used for all experiments in the revised version to ensure reproducibility. We will also consider adding confidence intervals.\n\n*   **Dataset license and usage restrictions:** The reviewer points out the lack of dataset license and usage restrictions. We will add explicit license and consent statements for datasets used in the revised version.\n\n*   **Figure labels and descriptions:** The reviewer notes the lack of clear labels and descriptions for Figures 3 and 4. We will add axis labels and units to Figure 3 and provide a clear legend for Figure 4.\n\n*   **Table 1 statistical significance:** The reviewer requests p-values or confidence intervals in Table 1. We will include p-values or confidence intervals in Table 1 to indicate the statistical significance of the performance differences between methods.\n\n*   **Definition of 'probabilistic pseudo mappings':** The reviewer requests a clear definition of 'probabilistic pseudo mappings'. We believe the definition is provided in Section 4.2, where we explain how the teacher model generates the probabilistic pseudo mapping matrix. We will add a more explicit definition in the abstract and introduction to avoid any confusion.\n\n*   **Lack of a notation table:** The reviewer points out the lack of a notation table. We acknowledge this omission and will include a notation table in the revised version to improve readability.\n\n*   **Bias, implications, and misuse cases:** The reviewer raises concerns about potential biases, implications, and misuse cases. We will add a section discussing potential biases in the data and how the method might amplify them, and add a section on potential misuse cases and mitigation strategies. We will also discuss the ethical implications of the technology in different application domains.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Detailed comparison with state-of-the-art:** We believe Section 5.2 already provides a detailed comparison with the state-of-the-art methods. We will consider adding a brief summary of the key characteristics of each baseline in the revised version to further clarify their differences.\n\n*   **Specific experimental results in the main text:** As mentioned above, we will revise Section 5.3 to explicitly highlight the key results and their implications.\n\n*   **Hyperparameter analysis in the main text:** We will include a concise summary of the key findings from Appendix D in Section 6.3 to improve accessibility.\n\n*   **Detailed model architecture and training procedure:** We believe the paper provides sufficient information. Section 4.1 details the KG encoder, and Section 4.2 describes the teacher-student architecture, including the EMA update and loss functions. We will clarify the architecture of the teacher and student models in Section 4.2 to avoid any confusion.\n\n*   **Report standard deviation and specify random seeds:** We will report the standard deviation for all results in Table 1 and include the random seeds used for all experiments in the revised version to ensure reproducibility. We will also consider adding confidence intervals.\n\n*   **Source code and data:** We will provide the source code and data used in the experiments to ensure reproducibility, including the specific versions of the libraries and the environment used.\n\n*   **License and consent statements:** We will add explicit license and consent statements for datasets used in the revised version.\n\n*   **Figure labels and descriptions:** We will add axis labels and units to Figure 3 and provide a clear legend for Figure 4.\n\n*   **P-values or confidence intervals in Table 1:** We will include p-values or confidence intervals in Table 1 to indicate the statistical significance of the performance differences between methods.\n\n*   **Detailed explanation of BDV and MDR:** We believe the Bi-directional Voting (BDV) strategy and the Matching Diversity-based Rectification (MDR) module are well-explained in Section 4.2. We will add a more detailed explanation in the abstract and introduction to avoid any confusion.\n\n*   **Discussion of biases, misuse, and ethical implications:** We will add a section discussing potential biases in the data and how the method might amplify them, and add a section on potential misuse cases and mitigation strategies. We will also discuss the ethical implications of the technology in different application domains.\n\nWe are confident that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
