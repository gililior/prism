  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel approach to combine the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) for e-commerce pre-sales dialogues, proposing two collaboration methods. The authors have addressed some of the weaknesses raised in the initial review, particularly regarding the clarity of the collaboration methods and the identification of the LLMs and CRSs used. However, the paper still requires significant improvements in experimental setup, statistical rigor, and a thorough comparison with existing state-of-the-art approaches.",
