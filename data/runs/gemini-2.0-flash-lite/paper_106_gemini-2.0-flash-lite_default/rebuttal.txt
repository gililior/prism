    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Weakness 1:** \"The paper lacks a detailed discussion of the specific architectures of the LLMs and CRSs used, making it difficult to assess the generalizability of the proposed methods.\" (Sec 1, Sec 2)\n    *   **Response:** We respectfully disagree. While we did not provide an exhaustive architectural deep dive due to space constraints, Section 3.2 and 3.3 clearly state the LLMs (ChatGLM-6B, Chinese-Alpaca-7B) and CRSs (UniMIND(BART), UniMIND(CPT)) used. We also cite the original papers for these models (Brown et al., 2020; Cui et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2023; Shao et al., 2021). Furthermore, the paper's focus is on the *collaboration* methodology, not the internal workings of the base models. Generalizability is discussed in the conclusion and future work.\n\n*   **Weakness 2:** \"The paper does not provide details on the computational environment (hardware, software versions, libraries) or the seeds used for experiments, making it impossible to assess the variance and reproducibility of the results.\" (Entire paper)\n    *   **Response:** This is a valid point. We acknowledge this omission and will include a detailed description of the computational environment, including hardware (NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB GPUs), software versions (PyTorch, Transformers library versions), and library dependencies (requirements.txt) in the supplementary material for the camera-ready version. We will also include the random seeds used for all experiments to ensure reproducibility.\n\n*   **Weakness 3:** \"The paper's claims regarding the effectiveness and generalizability of the collaboration methods are overreaching and lack sufficient supporting evidence or quantitative analysis.\" (Sec 6)\n    *   **Response:** We believe the experimental results in Section 5, particularly Tables 1-4, provide substantial evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed collaborations. We will strengthen the discussion in Section 5 and 6 by providing a more detailed analysis of the specific scenarios where the collaboration is most effective, including quantitative comparisons of the performance gains across different categories and tasks. We will also add a more explicit discussion on the limitations of our findings and potential avenues for future research to improve generalizability.\n\n*   **Weakness 4:** \"The exact methods of collaboration are not fully explained, and the paper lacks a clear definition of the tasks and evaluation metrics.\" (Abstract, ยง1)\n    *   **Response:** We respectfully disagree. The abstract and Section 3.4 and 3.5 clearly explain the two collaboration methods (CRS assisting LLM and LLM assisting CRS). Section 3.1 provides an overview of the tasks, and Appendix A provides detailed definitions. Section 4.4 describes the evaluation metrics. We will revise the abstract to provide a more concise summary of the collaboration methods.\n\n*   **Weakness 5:** \"The tables lack crucial statistical information such as standard deviations, confidence intervals, and p-values, hindering the assessment of the significance of the performance differences.\" (Tables 1-4)\n    *   **Response:** We agree. We will include standard deviations and p-values (using appropriate statistical tests) in Tables 1-4 to indicate the statistical significance of the performance differences between the methods in the camera-ready version.\n\n*   **Weakness 6:** \"The paper does not address dataset licensing, consent, or privacy considerations, and lacks a discussion of potential misuse or failure modes.\" (Insufficient evidence)\n    *   **Response:** This is a crucial point. We will add an explicit statement regarding the U-NEED dataset's license and our commitment to using it solely for research purposes in the Ethics Statement. We will also add a discussion of potential misuse and failure modes, including strategies to mitigate potential privacy risks.\n\n*   **Weakness 7:** \"The paper does not explicitly compare the proposed methods with the state-of-the-art conversational recommender systems or LLM-based recommendation approaches.\" (Related Work)\n    *   **Response:** We acknowledge this omission. We will add a more explicit comparison with the state-of-the-art conversational recommender systems and LLM-based recommendation approaches in the related work section, citing relevant papers and discussing the key differences between our approach and existing methods.\n\n*   **Weakness 8:** \"Figures 3, 4, and 5 rely heavily on highlighting and may not be easily interpretable without careful reading.\" (Figures 3, 4, 5)\n    *   **Response:** We will revise Figures 3, 4, and 5 to use a more structured format (e.g., tables or side-by-side comparisons) to clearly illustrate the collaboration process and its impact. We will also provide more detailed captions and explanations.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   We have addressed the suggestions related to providing code, data, experimental setup, statistical information, dataset licensing, and figure clarity above.\n\n*   We will conduct experiments comparing the proposed methods with relevant baselines and LLM-based recommendation approaches and provide an ablation study to isolate the impact of each collaboration method and the contribution of each component.\n\n*   We will add a Broader Impact section with mitigation strategies in the conclusion.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
