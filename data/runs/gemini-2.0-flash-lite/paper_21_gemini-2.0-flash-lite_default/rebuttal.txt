    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We have carefully considered each point and provide the following responses.\n\n**Addressing Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Weakness 1:** The paper does include comparisons with relevant baselines. We respectfully disagree with the reviewer's assessment that the paper lacks direct comparison with the most relevant baseline methods. As shown in Section 4.2, we adopt several previous methods as baselines, including LIWC+SVM, TF-IDF+SVM, W2V+CNN, Glove+LSTM, Regression, BERT, RoBERTa, SN+Attn, TrigNet, and DDGCN. We believe these baselines provide a comprehensive comparison against existing methods in the field.\n\n*   **Weakness 2:** The paper does provide details on the source of the text data. The reviewer appears to have overlooked Section 4.1, which explicitly states the datasets used: Essays (Pennebaker and King, 1999) and Kaggle. We will enhance this section by providing links to the datasets and their terms of use in the next version.\n\n*   **Weakness 3:** The paper acknowledges the potential for bias. We partially addressed this concern in the Ethics Statement (Section 6), where we state that the datasets are publicly available and anonymized. We will expand this section in the next version to include a more detailed discussion of potential biases in the datasets and the LLM, and outline mitigation strategies.\n\n*   **Weakness 4:** We acknowledge the lack of clear axis labels and units in Figure 3. We will revise Figure 3 to include clear axis labels and units, and provide a more descriptive caption, as suggested.\n\n*   **Weakness 5:** The paper does provide details on the methodology. The reviewer appears to have overlooked Section 3.2 and Algorithm 1, which explain the specifics of the PsyCoT framework, including prompt design and the scoring mechanism. We will enhance the clarity of these sections by providing more explicit examples of the prompts used.\n\n*   **Weakness 6:** We acknowledge the lack of detailed statistical information in Tables 1, 2, and 3. We will include standard deviations and confidence intervals in Tables 1 and 2, and specify the statistical tests used in Table 3 in the next version.\n\n*   **Weakness 7:** The paper addresses the potential for misuse in the Ethics Statement (Section 6). We will expand this section to include a more detailed discussion of the potential for the model to be used to create profiles of individuals without their consent and propose mitigation strategies.\n\n*   **Weakness 8:** We will include seed reporting in the next version to address the variance across runs.\n\n**Addressing Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Suggestion 1:** We plan to release the code and scripts with a reproducible environment file. (GitHub link placeholder)\n\n*   **Suggestion 2:** We provide details on the questionnaires used in Section 6 and Appendix D. We will enhance this section by providing more rationale for their selection.\n\n*   **Suggestion 3:** Addressed in Weakness 2.\n\n*   **Suggestion 4:** Addressed in Weakness 3.\n\n*   **Suggestion 5:** We have already included a comparative experiment with several baselines, as shown in Section 4.2. We will consider including a state-of-the-art fine-tuning method and a method that incorporates questionnaires in the next version. We have already included an ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the chain-of-thought approach compared to a single-turn dialogue, as shown in Section 4.5.\n\n*   **Suggestion 6:** Addressed in Weakness 4.\n\n*   **Suggestion 7:** Addressed in Weakness 5.\n\n*   **Suggestion 8:** Addressed in Weakness 6.\n\n*   **Suggestion 9:** We will include a section on the limitations of the model and its societal scope in the next version.\n\n*   **Suggestion 10:** Addressed in Weakness 7.\n\n*   **Suggestion 11:** We have already conducted an ablation study, as shown in Section 4.5. We will consider comparing the performance of PsyCoT with a baseline model that uses the same LLM but without the questionnaire-based CoT and against the best-performing model from Yang et al. (2022) and Wang et al. (2023) in the next version."
