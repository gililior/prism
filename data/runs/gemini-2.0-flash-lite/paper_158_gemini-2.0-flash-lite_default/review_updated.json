  "summary": "This paper introduces Vocabulary Trimming (VT) as a method to reduce the size of multilingual language models while maintaining performance. The authors demonstrate that VT can achieve comparable or better results than the original models. The paper has been updated to address concerns regarding variance, novelty, figure clarity, statistical information, and comparisons. The authors will add a new experiment comparing VT with original multilingual LMs.",
