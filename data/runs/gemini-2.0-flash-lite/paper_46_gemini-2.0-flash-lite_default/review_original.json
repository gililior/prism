  "summary": "This paper introduces Structured Semantic Alignment (SSA), a novel metric for evaluating text-to-image generation models, focusing on semantic consistency. The paper demonstrates SSA's ability to capture fine-grained semantic nuances, but lacks sufficient evidence to fully support its claims and requires improvements in reproducibility and clarity.",
