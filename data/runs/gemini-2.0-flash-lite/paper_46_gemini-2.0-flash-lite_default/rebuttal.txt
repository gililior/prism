      "reviewer_concern": "The paper lacks sufficient evidence to distinguish the proposed method from the closest baselines and overclaims the superiority of SSA without providing sufficient evidence to support its claim as the best metric. (Related Work, Sec 4.2)",
      "response": "We thank the reviewer for this feedback. We respectfully disagree that the paper overclaims the superiority of SSA. Section 4.2, particularly Table 2, directly compares SSA with CLIP and R-score on the DrawBench benchmark, demonstrating SSA's superior ability to capture fine-grained semantic nuances. We also compare with existing metrics in Table 1. While we acknowledge that SSA is not a universally superior metric, we believe the results in Section 4.2 and the error analysis in Section 4.3 provide sufficient evidence to support our claims regarding its advantages in measuring fine-grained semantic consistency, especially in comparison to existing metrics. We will revise the text to more clearly emphasize the specific strengths of SSA and avoid overly broad claims of superiority. We will also add a more detailed discussion of the limitations of each metric in the related work section."

    {
      "reviewer_concern": "The paper does not provide information on the variance or standard deviation of the reported metrics, making it difficult to assess the statistical significance of the results. (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4)",
      "response": "We acknowledge this is a valid point. We will include the standard deviation for all reported metrics in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the revised version. We will also add p-values to indicate the statistical significance of the differences between the models' performances. This will allow for a better assessment of statistical significance."

    {
      "reviewer_concern": "The paper lacks details on the specific implementation of the SSA metric, making it difficult to reproduce the results, and does not specify the software environment. (Sec 4.1, Sections 4.1, 4.2)",
      "response": "We agree that reproducibility is crucial. We will provide a more detailed description of the SSA metric implementation in Section 3. We will also include the code, including training and evaluation scripts, and a requirements file to specify the software environment. We will report the random seeds used for all experiments in Section 4.1."

      "reviewer_concern": "Several figures, such as those showing error examples (Figures 4-7), lack clear labels or explanations of the visual elements, making it difficult to understand the specific issues being highlighted. (Fig 4-8, 11, 12)",
      "response": "We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We will add concise captions to Figures 4-7 explaining the nature of the errors. We will also improve the labels and explanations in Figures 8, 11, and 12 to enhance clarity. We believe this will make the error examples and comparisons easier to understand."

      "reviewer_concern": "The term 'structured semantic embeddings' is introduced without a clear definition, and the paper lacks a notation table, making it difficult to follow the mathematical formulations and the meaning of symbols. (Abstract, ยง1, Methods Section)",
      "response": "We acknowledge this oversight. We will provide a clear definition of 'structured semantic embeddings' in the introduction and methods sections. We will also include a notation table to clarify the meaning of all symbols used in the mathematical formulations. This will improve the readability and understanding of the paper."

      "response": "We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We will add a more detailed comparison of SSA with SOA [2] in the Related Work section. We will explicitly address how SSA overcomes the limitations of SOA, particularly its unsuitability for datasets with single objects, by explaining how our method handles the evaluation of semantic consistency even in such cases. We will also clarify that SOA is not suitable for datasets where only one object appears in the generated images, as stated in the Related Work section."

      "response": "We appreciate the suggestion. While a head-to-head comparison with contemporaneous methods would be ideal, the computational resources required to train and evaluate these models are significant. We will include a comparison with Df-GAN [1] and AttnGAN [3] using the proposed SSA metric, as well as existing metrics like CLIP score and R-score in the revised version. We will also add a more detailed discussion of the limitations of each metric in the related work section."

      "response": "We agree with the need for a more detailed analysis. We will expand the analysis of the SSA metric in Section 4.2, including its sensitivity to different types of semantic variations. We will also include a more detailed error analysis to understand the specific failure cases of each model, as suggested. This will provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of SSA."
