The main contribution of the paper is the development of a new evaluation method that measures the semantic consistency between textual descriptions and generated images. The authors argue that existing metrics lack insights into the assessment of fine-grained semantic concepts, such as object attributes, context details, and semantic relationships. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SSA approach in evaluating text-to-image generation models.",

Specifically, this paper propose a new evaluation metric named Structured Semantic Alignment (SSA) to evaluate the semantic consistency between text and generated images. SSA first projects text/image features into a shared embedding space by text parsing and scene graph generation respectively. Then SSA is learned by contrastive learning. The positive and negative samples are generated by substituting words with semantically equivalent or nonequivalent alternatives.",

Otherwise, how to prove the proposed SSA is better than existing metrics like CLIP-score?\nThe accuacy of SSA is hignly depend on the scene graph generation of image. Therefore, I doubt about the practical effectiveness since existing scene graph generation models are not very preceise in practical use.\nComparison with human-based evaluation suce as \"ImageReward\" is necessary.",

Experiments demonstrate that the proposed evaluation allows for comprehensive and improved measurement of semantic consistency of text-to-image generation models.",
      "reasons_to_accept": "The proposed SSA framework is very interesting and I enjoyed reading this work. Experiments sufficiently demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework (although it could be further improved, please see reasons to reject). The notion of structured embeddings and the underlying principle of SSA presented in section 3.4 could be potentially useful in other tasks/domains. Overall the paper is solid with interesting and important contributions in T2I.",
      "reasons_to_reject": "I do not find any major weaknesses in the proposed work. One aspect that could be further improved to make the contribution strong is that the paper could have shown how well the proposed evaluation method could handle long prompts. As the main contribution/utility of the paper is to provide a better way to evaluate complex or long prompts, it would be useful to show how well the existing methods and the proposed SSA method evaluate the generated images with long descriptions. It\u2019s not very clear to me on the average length of prompts that were drawn from MS COCO. Please clarify. ( I assume mutations do not change the length of the prompt). Another suggestion would be to add some comparisons of existing methods and SSA on prompts of varying lengths. That would be a really interesting analysis to perform. Finally, the paper compares only one compositional T2I baseline (i.e. composable diffusion). For evaluating SSA, it would have been better to also consider more compositional generation baselines such as below: Feng, Weixi, Xuehai He, Tsu-Jui Fu, Varun Jampani, Arjun Akula, Pradyumna Narayana, Sugato Basu, Xin Eric Wang, and William Yang Wang. \" Training-free structured diffusion guidance for compositional text-to-image synthesis.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.05032 (2022).\nJim\u00e9nez, \u00c1.
