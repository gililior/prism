    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our paper and providing constructive criticism. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Weakness 1:** \"The claim that CQE significantly outperforms related methods and a GPT-3 model is broad and lacks specific grounding beyond F1-score improvements; the exact methods compared are not specified.\" (Sec 5) - *Partially Addressed:* Section 4.5 and Table 3, 4, 5, and 6 explicitly compare CQE against Illinois Quantifier (IllQ), Quantulum3 (Q3), R-Txt, Grbd, and a GPT-3 baseline. We provide F1-score improvements. We will clarify in Section 5 by explicitly listing the compared methods again.\n*   **Weakness 2:** \"The paper lacks detailed comparative evidence to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CQE framework over existing methods, especially the Illinois Quantifier and Quantulum3. The paper mentions outperforming other libraries, but does not provide specific details or quantitative results.\" (Intro) - *Addressed:* We provide quantitative results in Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6, comparing CQE's performance (precision, recall, F1-score) against IllQ and Q3, among others. We will ensure the introduction clearly references these tables.\n*   **Weakness 3:** \"The definition of 'concept' associated with detected values is not clearly defined, and its role in the CQE framework is not fully explained.\" (Abstract, §1, §3.1) - *Partially Addressed:* We define 'concept' in Section 3.1 and explain its role in Section 3.2.4. We will expand the definition in the abstract and introduction and provide more concrete examples throughout the paper to improve clarity.\n*   **Weakness 4:** \"Several tables lack crucial statistical information such as standard deviations, confidence intervals, or p-values to support the claims of significant improvements.\" (Tables 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) - *Addressed:* We report p-values in Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 to indicate statistical significance. We will add standard deviations to these tables in the next version.\n*   **Weakness 5, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17:** \"The paper does not address ethical considerations, including dataset licensing, privacy, and potential risks associated with the CQE system...The paper does not address fairness considerations related to the dataset or the extraction process...The paper lacks a discussion of the broader societal impacts of the CQE system...Add explicit license and consent statements for datasets used...Include a privacy policy or statement addressing data handling practices...Discuss potential biases in the dataset and the CQE system, and propose mitigation strategies.\" - *Acknowledged:* We acknowledge the importance of these considerations and will add a new section on ethical considerations, including dataset licensing (NewsQuant is public), potential biases, and societal impacts, in the next version.\n*   **Weakness 6:** \"No seed reporting; variance across runs unknown.\" (Sec 3.1) - *Acknowledged:* We will include seed reporting in the next version to ensure reproducibility.\n*   **Weakness 7:** \"Some figures lack clear axis labels and units, hindering interpretation. (Figures displaying performance metrics)\" - *Not Applicable:* There are no figures displaying performance metrics. The results are presented in tables.\n*   **Weakness 8:** \"The paper lacks a clear and consistent notation for the components of the quantity representation tuple (v, u, ch, cn). (§3.1)\" - *Addressed:* We define the components in Section 3.1. We will add a notation table to further clarify the symbols.\n*   **Weakness 9:** \"The paper does not discuss potential misuse scenarios or failure modes of the CQE system.\" - *Acknowledged:* We will add a section discussing potential misuse scenarios and failure modes.\n*   **Weakness 12, 13:** \"The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of its performance against existing quantity extraction systems like [1] (Qsearch) or [3] (AnaSearch). A quantitative comparison, including precision, recall, and F1-score, is missing...Evaluate the proposed method using the same dataset as [1] and [3]. Include a discussion of the performance differences, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Analyze the impact of using different quantity extraction tools (e.g., Quantulum3, Illinois Quantifier) on the overall system performance.\" (Related Work) - *Not Applicable:* We are not directly comparing against Qsearch or AnaSearch as they are not directly comparable. We will clarify this in the related work section.\n*   **Weakness 13:** \"The paper mentions the use of tools like Quantulum3 and Illinois Quantifier but does not thoroughly analyze their performance or limitations in the context of the proposed approach. A discussion on the choice of these tools and their impact on the overall system is missing.\" (Related Work) - *Addressed:* We analyze their performance and limitations in Section 4.5 and Table 3, 4, 5, and 6. We will clarify the impact of these tools in the related work section.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Suggestion 1:** \"Release code and scripts with a reproducible environment file.\" (GitHub link placeholder) - *Addressed:* The code and data are publicly available. We will include a link to the GitHub repository.\n*   **Suggestion 2:** \"Provide more details on the compared methods and GPT-3 model configurations.\" (Sec 5) - *Addressed:* We provide details in Section 4.4 and Appendix A.2. We will clarify in Section 5.\n*   **Suggestion 3:** \"Elaborate on the novelty of the concept detection task and its relation to existing work.\" (Sec 5) - *Addressed:* We will elaborate on the novelty in Section 5.\n*   **Suggestion 4:** \"Include a detailed comparison of the CQE framework with the Illinois Quantifier and Quantulum3, providing quantitative results on the NewsQuant dataset, including precision, recall, and F1-score for quantity extraction, unit normalization, and concept extraction.\" (Related Work) - *Addressed:* We provide these results in Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n*   **Suggestion 5:** \"Provide a clear definition and examples of the 'concepts associated with detected values' and how they are extracted by the CQE framework.\" (Intro) - *Addressed:* We will expand the definition and provide more examples.\n*   **Suggestion 6:** \"Include error bars to indicate statistical significance and confidence intervals in performance plots.\" (Figures showing performance metrics) - *Not Applicable:* We present results in tables, not plots.\n*   **Suggestion 7:** \"Provide a more detailed definition of 'concept' and its role in the CQE framework, including examples.\" (Abstract, §1, §3.1) - *Addressed:* We will expand the definition and provide more examples.\n*   **Suggestion 8:** \"Introduce a notation table to define the symbols used in the quantity representation tuple (v, u, ch, cn) and their meanings.\" (§3.1) - *Addressed:* We will add a notation table.\n*   **Suggestion 9:** \"Include standard deviations and/or confidence intervals for all reported metrics. Add p-values to indicate statistical significance of performance differences, especially where improvements are claimed. Clearly define the baselines used for comparison.\" (Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 9) - *Addressed:* We will add standard deviations.\n*   **Suggestion 18:** \"Expand on the methodology used for extracting the components of the quantity representation tuple, especially the 'change' component.\" (§3.1) - *Addressed:* We will expand on this in Section 3.2.3.\n\nWe believe these revisions will significantly improve the clarity and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
