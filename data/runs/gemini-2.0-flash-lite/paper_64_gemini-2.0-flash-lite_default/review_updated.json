  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel Comprehensive Quantity Extraction (CQE) framework and a new benchmark dataset, NewsQuant, demonstrating improved F1-scores compared to baselines. The paper has addressed some concerns regarding clarity and comparative evidence by pointing to existing content. However, the paper still needs to address several reproducibility, ethical, and clarity concerns, and provide more detail on the novelty of the concept detection task.",
