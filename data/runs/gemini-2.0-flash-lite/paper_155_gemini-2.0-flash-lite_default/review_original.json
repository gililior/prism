  "summary": "This paper offers a novel perspective on automated fact-checking by analyzing the epistemic elements (stakeholders, means, ends) within existing research. The paper identifies vagueness and lack of clarity in current narratives and provides recommendations for improvement. However, the paper's claims lack sufficient empirical grounding and the methodology could be more clearly explained.",
