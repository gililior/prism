    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback, which has helped us to clarify and strengthen our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Weakness 1:** \"The paper's claims about the limitations of current fact-checking narratives are broad and lack specific empirical grounding beyond the content analysis.\" (Sections 6, 8) - *Partially Addressed*. We acknowledge the reviewer's concern. While our primary grounding is the content analysis, Section 6 provides specific examples and findings derived from the analysis of 100 papers. Section 8 summarizes these limitations. We will enhance this by adding more specific examples of the 'vague or unrealistic terms' used in fact-checking papers, as suggested, and provide a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the content analysis methodology in the revised version.\n\n*   **Weakness 2:** \"The paper lacks a clear definition of 'overclaiming' and could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the methodology used for annotating the epistemic elements.\" (Introduction, Methods) - *Partially Addressed*. The introduction mentions overclaiming, and Section 3 and Appendix B provide a detailed explanation of the methodology. We will clarify the definition of 'overclaiming' in the introduction and improve the explanation of the annotation methodology, including a more explicit discussion of inter-annotator agreement, in the revised version.\n\n*   **Weakness 3:** \"The paper does not provide a detailed comparison with existing literature on the responsible design and deployment of AI systems or existing fact-checking systems.\" (Intro, Related Work) - *Partially Addressed*. Section 2, \"Related Work,\" discusses relevant studies. We will expand this section to include a more detailed comparative analysis with existing frameworks for responsible AI development and deployment, as suggested.\n\n*   **Weakness 4:** \"Dataset licensing, usage terms, consent, and privacy considerations for data subjects are not explicitly addressed.\" (Insufficient evidence) - *Missing*. We acknowledge this omission. In the revised version, we will add a section discussing dataset licensing, usage terms, consent, and privacy considerations, as well as a Broader Impact section with mitigation strategies.\n\n*   **Weakness 5:** \"Several figures lack clear axis labels, units, and legends, making it difficult to interpret the data accurately.\" (Fig 3, Fig 4) - *Partially Addressed*. We will ensure all axes are clearly labeled with units and provide comprehensive legends for all figures in the revised version.\n\n*   **Weakness 6:** \"Table 1 lacks statistical measures, and Table 2 lacks a measure of variance or statistical significance.\" (Tables 1 and 2) - *Missing*. We will include standard deviations or confidence intervals in Table 1 and add a measure of variance or statistical significance to Table 2 in the revised version.\n\n*   **Weakness 7:** \"The paper does not explicitly discuss the potential risks, misuse scenarios, or fairness considerations associated with automated fact-checking technologies, nor does it analyze broader societal impacts.\" (Insufficient evidence) - *Missing*. We will add a section on potential misuse scenarios, discuss fairness considerations, and outline mitigation strategies for identified risks and fairness concerns, as well as a Broader Impact section with mitigation strategies in the revised version.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Suggestion 1:** \"Provide more specific examples of the 'vague or unrealistic terms' used in fact-checking papers and include a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the content analysis methodology.\" (Section 8, Section 6) - *Addressed*. We will incorporate this suggestion as part of our response to Weakness 1.\n\n*   **Suggestion 2:** \"Provide a table or list defining the key terms used in the analysis (e.g., data actors, application means, epistemic ends) and expand on the discussion of how the recommendations can be implemented in practice.\" (Introduction, Figure 2, Recommendations) - *Partially Addressed*. Figure 2 and Appendix B already define key terms. We will expand the discussion of how the recommendations can be implemented in practice in the Recommendations section.\n\n*   **Suggestion 3:** \"Conduct a comparative analysis of the identified narratives with existing frameworks for responsible AI development and deployment (e.g., fairness, accountability, and transparency).\" (Related Work) - *Addressed*. We will incorporate this suggestion as part of our response to Weakness 3.\n\n*   **Suggestion 4:** \"Provide concrete examples of how the proposed recommendations can be implemented in the design and evaluation of automated fact-checking systems.\" (Sec 1.4) - *Partially Addressed*. We will expand on this in the Recommendations section.\n\n*   **Suggestion 5:** \"Encourage the papers analyzed to include explicit license and consent statements for datasets used, address privacy considerations, and include usage terms for the automated fact-checking tools. (Based on the analysis of the paper's recommendations.)\" - *Addressed*. We will incorporate this suggestion as part of our response to Weakness 4.\n\n*   **Suggestion 6:** \"Ensure all axes are clearly labeled with units and provide comprehensive legends for all figures. Include standard deviations or confidence intervals in Table 1 and add a measure of variance or statistical significance to Table 2.\" (Figures 3-7, Tables 1 and 2) - *Addressed*. We will incorporate this suggestion as part of our response to Weaknesses 5 and 6.\n\n*   **Suggestion 7:** \"Include a section on potential misuse scenarios, discuss fairness considerations, and outline mitigation strategies for identified risks and fairness concerns. Add a Broader Impact section with mitigation strategies.\" - *Addressed*. We will incorporate this suggestion as part of our response to Weakness 7.\n\n*   **Suggestion 8:** \"Conduct a comparative analysis of the epistemic elements (means, ends, stakeholders) in the current paper's analysis with the design and evaluation of existing fact-checking systems.\" (Sec X) - *Partially Addressed*. We will incorporate this suggestion as part of our response to Weakness 3.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
