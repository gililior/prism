  "summary": "This paper offers a novel perspective on automated fact-checking by analyzing the epistemic elements (stakeholders, means, ends) within existing research. The paper identifies vagueness and lack of clarity in current narratives and provides recommendations for improvement. The paper's claims are partially grounded in content analysis, and the methodology is partially explained. The authors have committed to addressing several weaknesses and suggestions in the revised version.",
