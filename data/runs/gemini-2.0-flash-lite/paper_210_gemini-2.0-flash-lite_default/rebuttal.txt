    "rebuttal": "We thank the reviewer for their insightful and detailed feedback. We appreciate the opportunity to clarify our work and address the concerns raised.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Weakness 1: Lack of strong evidence to distinguish from the closest baseline and detailed computational cost analysis.**\n    *   **Addressed:** We believe the paper already provides a strong comparison with baselines, including top-2 gating MoE, which is the closest baseline. Table 3 and the corresponding discussion in Section 4.4 directly compare adaptive gating with top-2 gating across multiple NLP tasks, demonstrating comparable or improved performance with reduced training time. The computational cost analysis is presented in Table 1, which quantifies the computation savings and running time reduction of the MoE layer. The reviewer may have overlooked these sections.\n\n*   **Weakness 2: Lack of statistical analysis details.**\n    *   **Partially Addressed:** We acknowledge the need for more rigorous statistical analysis. While we report the overall performance in Table 3, we did not explicitly include standard deviations, p-values, or the random seeds used. We will add these details to the next version of the paper. We will report the random seeds used for each experiment and include standard deviations and p-values to indicate statistical significance in Tables 3, 5, and 6. We will also clarify the number of runs used to generate the results in the table captions.\n\n*   **Weakness 3: Lack of dataset licensing, consent, privacy, misuse, fairness, and societal impact discussion.**\n    *   **Missing:** We acknowledge this is a crucial aspect and will add a new section to address dataset licensing, usage terms, consent, and privacy considerations. We will also include a discussion of potential misuse cases, mitigation strategies, fairness considerations, and broader societal impacts in the revised manuscript.\n\n*   **Weakness 4: Lack of clear definition of 'linguistic complexity' and mathematical formulation.**\n    *   **Partially Addressed:** We define 'linguistic complexity' in the context of token processing in Section 3.2, where we describe how we use the ratio of tokens processed by top-2 experts to the sequence length as a proxy for complexity. We will expand this definition and provide more concrete examples. We will also include a mathematical formulation of the adaptive gating mechanism, explicitly defining the threshold parameter T and the load balancing loss in Section 3.1. We will also add a table summarizing the notation used.\n\n*   **Weakness 5: Figure 1 and table statistical information.**\n    *   **Partially Addressed:** We will improve Figure 1 by adding clear axis labels and units to the figure. We will also include standard deviations or confidence intervals in all tables and add p-values to indicate statistical significance in Tables 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Suggestion 1: Head-to-head comparison and detailed computational cost analysis.**\n    *   **Addressed:** As mentioned above, we already provide a head-to-head comparison with top-2 gating MoE in Section 4.4 and Table 3. Table 1 provides a detailed analysis of the computational cost savings. We will strengthen this further by incorporating the suggested statistical analysis.\n\n*   **Suggestion 2: Variance, seeds, and code repository.**\n    *   **Addressed:** We will include the random seeds used and provide a link to the code repository in the next version of the paper. We will also include standard deviations and p-values to indicate statistical significance in Tables 3, 5, and 6.\n\n*   **Suggestion 3 & 4: Dataset licenses, misuse, fairness, and societal impact.**\n    *   **Missing:** We will add a new section to address these concerns.\n\n*   **Suggestion 5: Define 'linguistic complexity' and provide examples, include a mathematical formulation of the adaptive gating mechanism, and provide a table summarizing the notation used.**\n    *   **Partially Addressed:** We will expand the definition of 'linguistic complexity' and provide more concrete examples. We will also include a mathematical formulation of the adaptive gating mechanism and a table summarizing the notation used.\n\n*   **Suggestion 6: Improve Figure 1 and table statistical information.**\n    *   **Partially Addressed:** We will improve Figure 1 by adding clear axis labels and units. We will also include standard deviations or confidence intervals in all tables and add p-values to indicate statistical significance in Tables 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6."
