  "summary": "This paper introduces the compositionality gap as a novel metric for evaluating compositional reasoning in language models and proposes a new method, self-ask, to improve performance. Self-ask demonstrates promising results, particularly with search engine integration. The paper has been updated to address concerns regarding reproducibility, statistical information, and potential biases.",
