  "summary": "This paper introduces the compositionality gap as a novel metric for evaluating compositional reasoning in language models and proposes a new method, self-ask, to improve performance. While self-ask demonstrates promising results, particularly with search engine integration, the paper lacks crucial details for reproducibility and a thorough comparative analysis.",
