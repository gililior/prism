  "summary": "This paper introduces Baize, an open-source chat model created using a novel pipeline that leverages ChatGPT for multi-turn dialogue corpus generation and parameter-efficient tuning with Self-Distillation with Feedback (SDF). The paper demonstrates a promising approach and addresses some of the initial weaknesses, but still requires more details regarding reproducibility, comprehensive comparisons, and thorough evaluation of the SDF technique.",
