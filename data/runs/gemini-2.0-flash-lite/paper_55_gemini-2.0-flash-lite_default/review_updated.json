  "summary": "This paper investigates the impact of different optimization methods on retaining semantic knowledge while learning syntactic information in language models. The paper demonstrates that methods like GS and EWC improve performance on tasks requiring syntactic understanding, as indicated by lower PPL scores and higher scores in CoLA and MRPC tasks. The claims lack sufficient statistical support and generalizability needs further validation. The authors have committed to addressing the weaknesses identified in the review, including adding statistical analysis, improving reproducibility, expanding the evaluation, and providing a more detailed analysis of syntactic features.",
