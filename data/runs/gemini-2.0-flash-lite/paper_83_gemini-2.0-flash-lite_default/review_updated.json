  "summary": "This paper investigates biases in a text-to-image model, finding that the model associates the concept of 'person' with a Western, light-skinned man and continental stereotypes. The study provides evidence for these biases. The authors will clarify the novelty of their work, improve reproducibility, address figure/table clarity, and expand the discussion of potential harms and mitigation strategies. The authors will also add explicit license and consent statements for datasets used.",
