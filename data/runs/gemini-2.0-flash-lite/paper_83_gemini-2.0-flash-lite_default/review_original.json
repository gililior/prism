  "summary": "This paper investigates biases in a text-to-image model, finding that the model associates the concept of 'person' with a Western, light-skinned man and continental stereotypes. While the study provides evidence for these biases, the lack of reproducibility, insufficient detail on methodology, and limited discussion of potential harms and mitigation strategies weaken the overall contribution.",
