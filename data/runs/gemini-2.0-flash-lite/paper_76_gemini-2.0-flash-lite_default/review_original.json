  "summary": "This paper investigates the relationship between narrative style, misinformation, and user engagement on Twitter, finding a connection between narrativity and higher engagement. The study utilizes GPT models and statistical modeling to support its claims. However, the paper suffers from a lack of detail regarding methodology, ethical considerations, and the generalizability of its findings.",
