    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time taken to thoroughly assess our work and provide constructive criticism. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Reproducibility (Section 4.1):** The reviewer notes a lack of information on random seeds and environment. We acknowledge this omission and will rectify it in the next version. We will include the specific random seeds used for each experiment and a dedicated section detailing the environment, including Python version, library versions, and hardware specifications. (Proposed Improvement)\n*   **Generalizability (Sec 7):** The reviewer suggests we overclaim generalizability. We respectfully disagree. While our study focuses on Twitter data during the COVID-19 pandemic, we explicitly acknowledge this limitation in Section 8 (Limitations). We state, \"As we used English-language data from Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic, the language present in the dataset will be biased to this particular population and may limit the ability to extrapolate conclusions about narrativity and misinformation to other contexts.\" We believe this upfront acknowledgement prevents overclaiming. We will consider experiments on other platforms in future work.\n*   **GPT Model Limitations:** The reviewer requests a more detailed analysis of GPT model limitations. We partially address this in Section 4.2, where we discuss the GPT model's lower recall compared to RoBERTa. We will expand this discussion to include the model's sensitivity to prompt engineering and potential biases in the next revision. (Proposed Improvement)\n*   **Figure 2 Axis Labels:** The reviewer points out the lack of axis labels and units in Figure 2. We acknowledge this oversight and will add clear axis labels and units (where applicable) and a legend to clarify the categories in the revised version. (Proposed Improvement)\n*   **Ethical Considerations (Insufficient Evidence):** The reviewer raises concerns about ethical considerations. We acknowledge the need for a more comprehensive discussion. We will add a new section to the revised manuscript detailing the data collection process, including how consent was obtained (if applicable, though we used publicly available datasets), privacy-preserving measures, and data usage terms. We will also include a section discussing potential ethical risks (e.g., spread of misinformation, privacy violations) and mitigation strategies. (Proposed Improvement)\n*   **Statistical Significance (Tables 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10):** The reviewer notes the lack of statistical information in several tables. We acknowledge this and will include standard deviations or confidence intervals to indicate the variability of the results in Tables 2, 3, 9, and 10. We will also add p-values to show the statistical significance of the differences between models or configurations. For Table 8, we will include counts and percentages. (Proposed Improvement)\n*   **Definition of User Engagement:** The reviewer requests a clear definition of 'user engagement'. We define user engagement in the Abstract and Introduction as the counts of retweets and likes. We will clarify this further in the revised version.\n*   **Biases and Fairness (Insufficient Evidence):** The reviewer requests a discussion of potential biases. We will add a section discussing potential biases in the datasets and models, as well as fairness considerations, in the next revision. (Proposed Improvement)\n*   **Text Classifier Details (Methods):** The reviewer requests more detail on the text classifier features. We will expand the description of the features and architectures used in the text classifiers in the Methods section of the revised manuscript. (Proposed Improvement)\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Code Repository:** We will provide a link to the code repository in the next version. (Proposed Improvement)\n*   **Experiments on Different Datasets:** We acknowledge the value of this suggestion and will consider it for future work.\n*   **GPT Model Limitations:** Addressed above.\n*   **Figure 2 Improvements:** Addressed above.\n*   **Ethical Considerations:** Addressed above.\n*   **Statistical Information:** Addressed above.\n*   **Annotation Process:** We provide a detailed explanation of the annotation process, including the guidelines used to identify narrative style in tweets, in Section 3.2 and Appendix A. We believe the reviewer may have overlooked this section.\n*   **User Engagement Definition:** Addressed above.\n*   **Key Notations Table:** We will consider adding a table summarizing the key notations used throughout the paper for clarity.\n*   **Broader Impact Section:** We will add a Broader Impact section with mitigation strategies in the Conclusion.\n*   **TweetEval Benchmark:** We will consider a comparative experiment using the TweetEval benchmark for future work.\n*   **Baseline Comparison:** We already include a baseline comparison with bag-of-words models with ngram features in Section 4.2 and Table 3. The reviewer may have overlooked this. We will ensure this is more clearly highlighted.\n\nWe are confident that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
