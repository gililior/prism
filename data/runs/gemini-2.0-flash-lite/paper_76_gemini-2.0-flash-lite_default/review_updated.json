  "summary": "This paper investigates the relationship between narrative style, misinformation, and user engagement on Twitter, finding a connection between narrativity and higher engagement. The study utilizes GPT models and statistical modeling to support its claims. The paper has been improved by clarifications regarding existing content, but still requires improvements in reproducibility, ethical considerations, and the generalizability of its findings.",
