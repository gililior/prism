  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel Cross-Modal Knowledge Transferring (CMKT) network for unsupervised temporal sentence grounding (TSG). The CMKT framework shows promise in predicting segment boundaries, and the authors have addressed some of the initial concerns regarding reproducibility, analysis, and clarity. The authors will include more details regarding the experimental setup and comparisons with other methods in the revised version.",
