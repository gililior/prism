    "rebuttal": "We thank the reviewer for their thorough and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort taken to review our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Dataset Privacy, Consent, Usage Terms, and Ethical Risk Disclosures:** The reviewer correctly points out the lack of explicit discussion on these aspects. We acknowledge this omission. While we discuss ethical implications in Section 9, we will expand this section in the next version to include a more detailed discussion of data privacy measures, data subject consent (as the dataset is generated by us), usage terms, and a more comprehensive ethical risk disclosure. We will also add an appendix (as suggested) to further clarify these points.\n\n*   **Definition of 'Internal State':** The reviewer is correct that a more precise definition of 'internal state' is needed. We believe the reviewer may have overlooked the initial definition. We define the 'internal state' as the activation values of the hidden layers of the LLM. We will clarify this definition further in the abstract and Section 1, explicitly stating that we are referring to the hidden layer activations. We will also add a table of notation to clarify the variables and symbols used in the paper, especially for the classifier and the LLM's internal representations.\n\n*   **Comparison with Existing Fact Verification Methods:** The reviewer is correct that a more direct comparison with state-of-the-art fact verification methods is needed. We address this in Section 2, where we discuss related work. However, we will expand this section in the next version to include a more direct comparison with a state-of-the-art fact verification method that uses LLMs, and quantify the performance difference between SAPLMA and the LLM's probability score more precisely. We will also add a table of notation to clarify the variables and symbols used in the paper, especially for the classifier and the LLM's internal representations.\n\n*   **Substantiation of Claims on Optimal Layer and Subjectivity:** We acknowledge that further analysis is needed to fully substantiate these claims. We will include more experiments to validate the claim that the truth value of the sentences generated by the LLM is more subjective. We will also add a table of notation to clarify the variables and symbols used in the paper, especially for the classifier and the LLM's internal representations.\n\n*   **Statistical Information in Tables:** We agree that the inclusion of standard deviations, confidence intervals, and p-values would strengthen our results. We will add this information to Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the next version. We will also add error bars to Figure 2.\n\n*   **Figure 2 Labels and Units:** The reviewer is correct. We will ensure that Figure 2 has clear labels and units in the next version.\n\n*   **Misuse Scenarios, Ethical Implications, and Fairness:** We acknowledge the need for a more in-depth discussion of these aspects. We address ethical implications in Section 9, but we will expand this section in the next version to include a more detailed discussion of potential misuse cases, limitations of SAPLMA and potential failure modes, and address fairness considerations. We will also add an appendix (as suggested) to further clarify these points.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Data Privacy, Consent, Usage Terms, and Ethical Risks:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Table of Notation:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Direct Comparison with State-of-the-Art:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Further Analysis of Layers and Subjectivity:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Statistical Information and Error Bars:** Addressed above.\n\n*   **Misuse Cases, Limitations, and Fairness:** Addressed above.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
