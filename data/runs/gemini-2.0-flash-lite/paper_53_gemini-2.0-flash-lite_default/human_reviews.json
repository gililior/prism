The proposed approach optimizes the visual extraction network only based on anomaly semantics but not normal semantics. The experiments show that the proposed method could outperform baselines.",
      "reasons_to_accept": "1. It is interesting to separately model normal and abnormal reports. \n2. The proposed approach could outperform baselines on the benchmark MIMIC-CXR dataset. \n3. The ablation study shows that each of the component could help improve the performance.",
      "reasons_to_reject": "1. The abnormal mode memory part is not quite clear, which is difficult to interpret. \n2. The proposed method is somewhat incremental. \n3. This paper only includes results of one dataset in the main text.",

      "paper_topic_and_main_contributions": "The paper introduces a novel concept to automatically generate radiology reports from radiographic images using normal-abnormal semantic decoupling network with abnormal pattern memory. The authors combine the concepts of abnormal semantics in reports with visual feature extraction to shape the decoder output. Their trained model achieves higher performance than state of the art models in all of the relevant metrics. In addition, the paper clearly analyses the model output by using model visualization which helps in understanding the model better. The writing is crisp, easy to understand and clearly explains the methodologies used in the paper without ambiguity.",
      "reasons_to_accept": "1. The methodology achieves higher than state-of-the-art for MIMIC CXR report generation. \n2. The methodology is novel, and involves an understanding the structure of radiology report findings beyond just caption generation problem for radiographic images. In radiology reports, the radiologists tend to write more about the abnormalities than focus on the normal perceptions in the report, and this architecture utilizes that aspect in their modeling quite well. \n3. The analysis of the model is rigorous and gives us a clear understanding of the types of errors to expect.",
      "reasons_to_reject": "1. Though one of the core concepts of the paper is normal-abnormal semantics in reports, the classification from the reports is largely dependent on keyword-based method, which, the authors accept is largely noisy. The definition of what is an abnormal semantics in a report varies depending on application, and there is no specification of any such definition followed in this paper. This makes the normal/abnormal semantic section a little weak compared to the other sections. \n-- After rebuttal: Even with the rebuttal, I think this portion could have been handled much better.",
      "questions_for_the_authors": "1. What are the details of GPUs used in the experiment and the number of epochs for training, and GPU hours? \n2. The paper mentions in line 51 that the presence of noise in reports impacts network optimization, and similar mentions of noise has been repeated in the paper a few times. Please elucidate the type of noise being referred to, and how it impacts network optimization 3. Is the paper using only the Finding section of the radiology report throughout the experiment? It is a bit unclear from the description. \n4. Which language model has been used for embeddings for training this model?",
      "missing_references": "Please cite Hungarian algorithm in line 221. Please cite the language model that has been used.",
      "typos_grammar_style_and_presentation_improvements": "1. The paper focuses on generating the Findings in a radiology report, which is an important detail that is only mentioned in line 871 in the Appendix section of the paper. This can be mentioned in the beginning. \n2. Please correct spacing around period in line 240. \n3. In line 294, Att definition is missing. \n4. In line 326 Cancat needs to be changed to Concat, and defined. \n5. Correct typo : Abnaormal -> Abnormal in table 5",

      "justification_for_ethical_concerns": "The paper does not have an ethics section, and since this pertains to a medical application, it is prudent to include a section detailing failures and biases of the model."

However, I won't object to accepting it if my co-reviewers champion it.",
