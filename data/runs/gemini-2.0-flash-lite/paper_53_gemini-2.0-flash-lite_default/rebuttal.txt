    "rebuttal": "We sincerely appreciate the reviewer's thorough and insightful feedback. We have carefully considered each point and provide detailed responses below.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Weakness 1:** \"The paper needs stronger evidence to distinguish the proposed model from the closest baselines (Related Work).\" We respectfully disagree. Table 1 and Table 2 in Section 5.1 provide a direct comparison with several state-of-the-art baselines, including those mentioned in the Related Work section. We believe the performance improvements demonstrated in these tables, along with the ablation studies in Section 5.2, sufficiently distinguish our model. The reviewer may have overlooked the comprehensive comparison presented.\n\n*   **Weakness 2:** \"The paper claims that decoupling semantics avoids noise, but it does not provide direct evidence or ablation studies to support this claim (Sec 6).\" This is partially addressed. Section A.3.1 (Table 4) and Section 5.2 (Table 3) present ablation studies directly comparing the performance of the decoupled semantic extraction method against other approaches. These results provide evidence supporting our claim. We will clarify this further in the revised manuscript by explicitly referencing Table 4 and Table 3 when discussing the benefits of semantic decoupling.\n\n*   **Weakness 3:** \"The paper overclaims the ability of the model to handle rare diseases and complex descriptions, as it acknowledges limitations in these areas (Sec 6).\" We believe this is a fair assessment. We acknowledge the limitations in Section 6, and we will strengthen this section by providing more concrete examples of failure cases related to rare diseases and complex descriptions, as suggested.\n\n*   **Weakness 4:** \"The paper does not explicitly mention the use of seeds or report variance across multiple runs (All sections).\" This is a valid point. We will address this in the revised manuscript by specifying the random seeds used for all experiments and reporting the variance (standard deviation) of the results across multiple runs. We will also include confidence intervals where appropriate.\n\n*   **Weakness 5:** \"The paper does not provide information about the computational resources used for training and evaluation (All sections).\" This is a valid point. We will add details about the hardware and software environment used for training and evaluation (e.g., GPU type, software versions) in Section A.2 and the main text.\n\n*   **Weakness 6:** \"Figure 3 lacks clear labels for the y-axis (BLEU-4 scores) and the x-axis (memory size multiplier) (Fig 3).\" The reviewer is correct. We will revise Figure 3 to include clear labels for both axes.\n\n*   **Weakness 7:** \"The tables lack information on the variance of the results, such as standard deviations or confidence intervals, and do not consistently provide p-values to indicate statistical significance (Tables 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9).\" This is a valid point. We will include standard deviations or confidence intervals and p-values where appropriate in Tables 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.\n\n*   **Weakness 8:** \"The term \"anomaly semantic extraction\" is used without a clear definition (Intro ยง1, ยง3).\" We will clarify the definition of \"anomaly semantic extraction\" in the introduction and Section 3 to provide a clearer understanding of the term.\n\n*   **Weakness 9:** \"Equation (1) is presented without defining all variables (Sec 3.1).\" This is a valid point. We will include a table of notation defining all symbols used in the equations to improve readability.\n\n*   **Weakness 10:** \"The paper does not discuss potential biases in the training data or the impact on different demographic groups (Insufficient evidence).\" This is a critical point. We will add a section on potential biases in the training data and their impact on different demographic groups. We will also discuss mitigation strategies.\n\n*   **Weakness 11:** \"The paper does not address the potential for the system to be used to generate inaccurate or misleading reports, or to be used in a way that could lead to misdiagnosis or delayed treatment (Insufficient evidence).\" This is a crucial point. We will add a section on potential misuse cases and mitigation strategies, such as human oversight and clear disclaimers.\n\n*   **Weakness 12:** \"The paper does not discuss the potential for the system to be used for malicious purposes, such as generating fake medical reports (Insufficient evidence).\" We will add a section on potential misuse cases and mitigation strategies, such as watermarking or other methods to detect fake reports.\n\n*   **Weakness 13:** \"The paper does not clearly explain how the proposed method differs from the encoder-decoder frameworks, attention mechanisms, and hierarchical LSTM models used in previous medical report generation approaches (e.g., Jing et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2019; Yin et al., 2019) (Related Work).\" We respectfully disagree. Section 2 (Related Work) and Section 3 (The Proposed Method) clearly explain the differences. Our method distinguishes itself through anomaly semantic extraction, the abnormal mode memory, and the abnormal pattern enhancement multi-head attention. We will revise the introduction to highlight these differences more explicitly.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Suggestion 1:** \"Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of the proposed framework components on the overall performance (Sec 6).\" This is already addressed in Section 5.2 (Table 3) and Section A.3.1 (Table 4).\n\n*   **Suggestion 2:** \"Provide more detailed analysis on the types of errors made by the model, especially for rare diseases and complex descriptions, to better understand its limitations (Sec 6).\" We will incorporate this suggestion into the revised manuscript.\n\n*   **Suggestion 3:** \"Specify and report the random seeds used for all experiments and report the variance of the results (All sections).\" We will implement this suggestion.\n\n*   **Suggestion 4:** \"Include details about the hardware and software environment used for training and evaluation (e.g., GPU type, software versions) (All sections).\" We will implement this suggestion.\n\n*   **Suggestion 5:** \"Include standard deviations or confidence intervals to show the variability of the results and add p-values to indicate the statistical significance of the differences between the proposed model and the baselines (Tables 1-9).\" We will implement this suggestion.\n\n*   **Suggestion 6:** \"Provide a table of notation defining all symbols used in the equations to improve readability (Sec 3.1, Equation (1)).\" We will implement this suggestion.\n\n*   **Suggestion 7:** \"Include a section on potential biases in the training data and their impact on different demographic groups. Discuss mitigation strategies such as data augmentation or re-weighting (Insufficient evidence).\" We will implement this suggestion.\n\n*   **Suggestion 8:** \"Add a section on potential misuse cases and mitigation strategies, such as watermarking or other methods to detect fake reports (Insufficient evidence).\" We will implement this suggestion.\n\n*   **Suggestion 9:** \"Discuss the potential for the system to be used to generate inaccurate or misleading reports, or to be used in a way that could lead to misdiagnosis or delayed treatment. Provide mitigation strategies such as human oversight and clear disclaimers (Insufficient evidence).\" We will implement this suggestion.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
