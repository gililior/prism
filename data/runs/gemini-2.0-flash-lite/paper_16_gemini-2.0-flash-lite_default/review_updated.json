  "summary": "This paper introduces CARP, a novel framework for text classification using LLMs, claiming state-of-the-art performance on several datasets. The authors have addressed some of the initial concerns regarding overclaiming and reproducibility. However, the lack of detailed ablation studies and comparisons to existing methods still limits the assessment of CARP's contribution. The authors have committed to addressing fairness and broader impact considerations.",
