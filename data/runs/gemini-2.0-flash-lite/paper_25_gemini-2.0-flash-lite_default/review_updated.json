  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel multilingual machine translation approach using pixel representations, aiming to overcome limitations of vocabulary-based methods. The paper demonstrates improved performance and addresses some weaknesses identified in the initial review, including clarifying comparisons with existing work and providing more detailed analysis of script and data representation. However, the paper still lacks crucial comparisons with relevant baselines and detailed analyses in some areas, hindering a comprehensive assessment of its contributions.",
