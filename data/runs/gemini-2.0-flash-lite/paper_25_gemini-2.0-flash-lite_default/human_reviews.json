      "reasons_to_reject": "1. It is suprising that you haven't experimented with different image conversion parameters, such as different fonts, font sizes and resolutions. Google Noto Sans 10pt at 120 dpi is a very specific setting. The question in Lines 218-220 implies that these variations need to be studied. \n 2. Similarly the statement on the source of improvements as in Lines 244-250 should have been studied. Does performance for \"ja\" improves when you add \"zh\"?",
      "typos_grammar_style_and_presentation_improvements": "1. The claim of \"up to 9 BLEU\" is misleading. Report the mean. And also chrF is more robust for neural models, so it's better to provide your main reporting for it. \n  2. Conneau et al 2020 present a very concise way to describe the contribution of individual properties of their architecture on the overall performance. \n 3. The reasons for choosing the specific languages in Table 2 are not clear. I think the pairing in this table is good as it includes related languages with different scripts  as well as unrelated languages with similar scripts. Please add an explanation.",

They evaluated the model on TED dataset with 7 and 49 languages with a variety of languages and script coverage, and improved the perforamnce compared to previous subword-based studies. Further analysis showed that pixel representation helps better cross-lingual transfer to unseen scripts and is more data efficient.",

      "reasons_to_accept": "The proposed pixel representations improve the crosslingual transfer between languages sharing a script, as well as enabling transfer between historically related but distinct scripts encoded with different unicode codepoints. \nThe proposed method is thus especially beneficial for low-resource languages using non-Latin scripts, a disadvantaged group of languages in NLP.\nModels using pixel representations are more robust when scaling the model size.",
