  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel unsupervised pre-training paradigm for news recommendation, demonstrating significant improvements over baselines on benchmark datasets. The authors have addressed several weaknesses and suggestions from the initial review, including clarifying statistical significance, improving figure clarity, and adding an ethics statement. However, the paper still needs to address the comparison with methods in [1] and [2] and provide a link to the code repository.",
