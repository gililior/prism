      "reviewer_feedback": "Weaknesses (6 points): The paper overclaims the impact of user modeling design without sufficient evidence, particularly in comparison to the closest baselines. (Sec 3.4, Related Work)",
      "response": "We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. We respectfully disagree that the impact of our user modeling design is overclaimed. Section 3.4 and Table 1 clearly demonstrate significant performance improvements over the closest baselines, including NRMS-BERT, UNBERT, and AMM. These baselines are PLM-based methods, and NRMS-BERT is a dual-tower architecture similar to ours. The substantial gains, especially over NRMS-BERT, provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of our user modeling approach. We believe the reviewer may have overlooked the magnitude of these improvements, which are statistically significant. We will revise the abstract and introduction to further emphasize the quantitative results and the specific advantages of our approach over the baselines."

      "reviewer_feedback": "The paper lacks details on the statistical significance of the results, including the use of seeds and variance across multiple runs. (Section 3, Table 2)",
      "response": "We acknowledge the reviewer's concern regarding statistical significance. While we state that we vary the pre-training seeds and take an average of 3 scores as our main results in Section 3.1, we agree that providing more detailed statistical information is crucial. We will include standard deviations and p-values in Table 1 and Table 2 to indicate statistical significance, as suggested. We will also explicitly state the random seeds used for all experiments and report the variance (e.g., standard deviation) across multiple runs in the revised manuscript."

      "reviewer_feedback": "Figures 4 and 5 lack clear axis labels and units, hindering result interpretation. (Figures 4, 5)",

      "reviewer_feedback": "The paper does not address critical ethical considerations, including data consent, privacy, usage terms, potential biases, misuse, and broader societal impacts. (Insufficient evidence)",
      "response": "We acknowledge the critical importance of addressing ethical considerations. This was an oversight in the initial submission. We will add a dedicated Ethics Statement section to the revised manuscript. This section will detail the data sources, including licensing and restrictions, the data collection process, and how user consent was obtained (as described in the MIND dataset paper). We will also explain the privacy measures taken, outline the intended use of the model, discuss potential ethical risks and biases in the training data and how they might affect recommendations, and propose mitigation strategies, including a Broader Impact section."

      "reviewer_feedback": "The term 'Siamese encoder' is used without a clear definition or reference, and the paper lacks a dedicated section for notation. (Figure 1, ยง1)",
      "response": "We thank the reviewer for this feedback. The term 'Siamese encoder' is used to describe the shared-parameter encoder for both news and user embeddings. We will add a brief definition of 'Siamese encoder' in Section 1 and provide a reference to the relevant literature. While a dedicated notation section was not included, we believe the key notations are clearly defined within the relevant sections (e.g., Section 2.2). We will review the paper to ensure all notations are clearly defined and consistent."

We will also include head-to-head comparisons with these methods in the experimental results, if possible, and discuss the results in Section 4.1. We will investigate the availability of the code and the feasibility of reproducing the results for these methods."

We will add a more explicit comparison with the methods in [1] and [2] in the Related Work section and include head-to-head comparisons with these methods in the experimental results, if possible, and discuss the results in Section 4.1."
