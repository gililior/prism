    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time taken to carefully review our work and provide constructive criticism. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Weakness 1: Lack of detailed explanation of toxicity lists (Sec 6).**\n    We respectfully disagree. Section 2, specifically the subsection \"Toxicity detection methodology,\" provides a detailed explanation of the toxicity lists used. We describe the categories of terms included (profanities, insults, etc.) and the method of detection (presence of at least one entry). We also acknowledge the limitations of wordlist-based detectors in Section 8. We believe the reviewer may have overlooked this section.\n\n*   **Weakness 2: Overclaiming generalizability (Sec 6).**\n    We acknowledge the reviewer's concern regarding the dataset's templated nature. We partially address this in Section 8, \"Limitations,\" where we explicitly state that HOLISTICBIAS is a template-based dataset and that our findings may not generalize to all settings. We also provide human evaluation on the FLORES-200 dataset in Appendix G to show that the findings are not solely due to the templated nature of the dataset.\n\n*   **Weakness 3: Lack of comparison to existing methods.**\n    We acknowledge this is a valid point. While we use the toxicity detection methodology from NLLB Team et al. (2022), we do not provide a direct quantitative comparison with other methods. We will add a discussion of related work and a comparison to relevant baselines in the revised version.\n\n*   **Weakness 4: Lack of statistical information in Table 1.**\n    We agree that the inclusion of confidence intervals or standard deviations would strengthen our analysis. We will add this information to Table 1 in the revised version.\n\n*   **Weakness 5: Unclear labels and units in Figure 3.**\n    We acknowledge this and will improve Figure 3 by adding clear labels to the axes and units where applicable in the revised version.\n\n*   **Weakness 6: Lack of clear explanation of 'source contribution'.**\n    We believe the reviewer may have overlooked the explanation in Section 2, \"ALTI+ method,\" and Section 5, \"Input Attributions.\" We will revise the Abstract and Section 1 to provide a clearer and more concise explanation of how source contribution is measured and interpreted within the context of ALTI+.\n\n*   **Weakness 7: Lack of explanation of ALTI+.**\n    We agree that a brief overview of ALTI+ would be beneficial. We will include a brief overview of the ALTI+ method in Section 2 and the Abstract, and we will direct the reader to the original paper for a more in-depth understanding.\n\n*   **Weakness 8: No discussion of potential misuse or failure modes.**\n    We address this in Section 9, \"Ethics statement,\" where we discuss unintended use, biases, and safety. We will expand this section to include a more explicit discussion of potential misuse and failure modes.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Suggestion 1: In-depth analysis of toxicity lists (Sec 6).**\n    We believe our current description in Section 2 is sufficient, but we will consider adding further details on the coverage and error types in the revised version.\n\n*   **Suggestion 2: Detailed comparison of results with other methods (Sec 6).**\n    We will incorporate this suggestion in the revised version.\n\n*   **Suggestion 3: Quantitative comparison with NLLB Team et al. (2022).**\n    We will incorporate this suggestion in the revised version.\n\n*   **Suggestion 4: Include standard deviations or confidence intervals in Table 1.**\n    We will incorporate this suggestion in the revised version.\n\n*   **Suggestion 5: Improve Figure 3 with clear labels and units.**\n    We will incorporate this suggestion in the revised version.\n\n*   **Suggestion 6: Detailed explanation of 'source contribution' (Abstract, Sec 1).**\n    We will incorporate this suggestion in the revised version.\n\n*   **Suggestion 7: Include a brief overview of ALTI+ (Abstract, Sec 1).**\n    We will incorporate this suggestion in the revised version.\n\n*   **Suggestion 8: Add a Broader Impact section with mitigation strategies (Conclusion).**\n    We will incorporate this suggestion in the revised version. We have already included initial experiments on toxicity mitigation in Appendix H.\n\nWe believe that addressing these points will significantly improve the clarity and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
