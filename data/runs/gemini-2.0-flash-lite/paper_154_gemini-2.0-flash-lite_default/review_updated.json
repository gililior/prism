  "summary": "This paper investigates the problem of added toxicity in machine translation across multiple languages, using a combination of existing toxicity detection methods, the HOLISTICBIAS dataset, and ALTI+ interpretability. The study provides quantitative results on false positive rates and insights into the causes of added toxicity, but lacks sufficient comparison to existing methods and clarity in some methodological aspects. The authors have provided clarifications regarding the methodology and addressed some of the weaknesses.",
