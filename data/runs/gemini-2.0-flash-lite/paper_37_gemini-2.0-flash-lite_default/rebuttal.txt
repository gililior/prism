    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed and insightful feedback. We appreciate the time and effort taken to thoroughly evaluate our work. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Weakness 1: Insufficient evidence to distinguish INSTRUCTOR from closest baselines.**\n    *   **Addressed:** We believe the paper provides sufficient evidence. We compare INSTRUCTOR against three unsupervised baselines (Rewrite, HyDE, and query2doc) that also leverage LLMs, as detailed in Section 4.3. Table 1 demonstrates INSTRUCTOR's superior performance on QReCC and TopiOCQA compared to these baselines. The reviewer may have overlooked this direct comparison.\n\n*   **Weakness 2: Overclaiming generalizability due to limitations in experimental setup and datasets.**\n    *   **Partially Addressed:** We acknowledge the limitations of our datasets (QReCC, TopiOCQA, CAsT-19, and CAsT-20) in Section 4.1. We also perform zero-shot experiments on CAsT-19 and CAsT-20 to evaluate transferability. We will expand our experiments to include more diverse datasets in the next version.\n\n*   **Weakness 3: Conclusion overstates significance without acknowledging limitations.**\n    *   **Partially Addressed:** We acknowledge limitations in the Conclusion (Section 6). We will revise the Conclusion to more explicitly emphasize the scope of our findings and the need for further research, particularly regarding dataset diversity and LLM scaling.\n\n*   **Weakness 4: No reporting of variance or random seeds.**\n    *   **Missing:** We will address this in the next version by specifying the random seeds used for all experiments and reporting standard deviations across multiple runs. This will be included in Section 3 and 4.\n\n*   **Weakness 5: No information about the environment used.**\n    *   **Missing:** We will include details about the hardware and software environment used for training and evaluation in the next version. This will be added to Section 4.2.\n\n*   **Weakness 6: Figures lack detailed labels and clear visual explanations.**\n    *   **Partially Addressed:** We will improve the figures by adding more descriptive labels, annotations, and axis labels with units. Legends will be added to clarify the meaning of different colors and line styles. This will be applied to Figures 1-12.\n\n*   **Weakness 7: Tables lack detailed statistical information.**\n    *   **Missing:** We will include standard deviations, confidence intervals, and p-values in Tables 1-4 to provide a more complete statistical analysis in the next version.\n\n*   **Weakness 8: Lack of clarity in the definition of 'instructing strategies'.**\n    *   **Partially Addressed:** We provide detailed explanations of the three instructing strategies (INSTRUCTORCRCG, INSTRUCTORQRLV, and INSTRUCTORQRPG) in Section 3.2. We will revise this section to provide even clearer explanations of the implementation details.\n\n*   **Weakness 9: Does not address potential biases, risks, or misuse.**\n    *   **Missing:** We will add a Broader Impact section to address potential risks, fairness, and misuse, and discuss mitigation strategies in the next version.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Suggestion 1: Include a head-to-head comparison with a contemporaneous method.**\n    *   **Addressed:** We will include a head-to-head comparison with a contemporaneous method in the next version. We will select a relevant recent work and incorporate it into our experimental comparisons.\n\n*   **Suggestion 2: Conduct experiments on a wider range of datasets and retrieval models.**\n    *   **Acknowledged:** We plan to expand our experiments to a wider range of datasets and retrieval models in future work, as mentioned in our response to Weakness 2.\n\n*   **Suggestion 3: Provide a link to the code repository.**\n    *   **Addressed:** We will provide a link to the code repository, including the training and evaluation scripts, and include a requirements.txt or equivalent for environment setup upon acceptance, as stated in our Ethics Statement.\n\n*   **Suggestion 4: Specify the random seeds and report variance.**\n    *   **Acknowledged:** We will implement this suggestion, as mentioned in our response to Weakness 4.\n\n*   **Suggestion 5: Provide details about the hardware and software environment.**\n    *   **Acknowledged:** We will implement this suggestion, as mentioned in our response to Weakness 5.\n\n*   **Suggestion 6: Improve figures.**\n    *   **Acknowledged:** We will implement this suggestion, as mentioned in our response to Weakness 6.\n\n*   **Suggestion 7: Include standard deviations, confidence intervals, and p-values in Tables.**\n    *   **Acknowledged:** We will implement this suggestion, as mentioned in our response to Weakness 7.\n\n*   **Suggestion 8: Provide a more detailed explanation of the three instructing strategies.**\n    *   **Acknowledged:** We will implement this suggestion, as mentioned in our response to Weakness 8.\n\n*   **Suggestion 9: Include a section detailing the loss function or scoring mechanism.**\n    *   **Addressed:** The loss function is described in Section 3.1 (Equation 6), and the scoring mechanism is described in Section 2.3 and 3.2. We will clarify the connection between these sections.\n\n*   **Suggestion 10: Include a Broader Impact section.**\n    *   **Acknowledged:** We will implement this suggestion, as mentioned in our response to Weakness 9."
