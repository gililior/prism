  "summary": "This paper introduces INSTRUCTOR, a method for improving conversational retrieval. The paper demonstrates INSTRUCTOR's effectiveness on multiple datasets, but the claims of generalizability are not fully supported by the experimental setup. The paper would benefit from addressing limitations in statistical analysis, clarity of methods, and potential societal impacts.",
