  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel Structural Causal Model (SCM) approach for affective reasoning in conversations, demonstrating effectiveness on ECPE and ECSR tasks. The paper has been updated to address concerns about baselines, statistical rigor, reproducibility, and clarity, but still needs to address some concerns regarding societal impact and ethics.",
