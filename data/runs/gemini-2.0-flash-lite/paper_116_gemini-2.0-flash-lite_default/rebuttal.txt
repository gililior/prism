    "rebuttal": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their insightful and thorough feedback. We appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our paper. We address each point below:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Insufficient detail on baselines (Sec 4.1):** We believe Section 4.1 provides sufficient detail. We explicitly state that we use the same pre-trained embedding and downstream task modules as the SOTA baselines (DAG-ERC and EGAT) for a fair comparison. We also provide the specific works from which we designed each cogn skeleton. The reviewer may have overlooked this. We will clarify this further in the revised version by explicitly listing the key characteristics of each baseline in a table.\n\n*   **Lack of evidence for ablation and latent variable distribution (Sec 4.2, Sec 4.4):** We respectfully disagree. Section 4.2 includes Table 4, which presents ablation results demonstrating the contribution of each component. Section 4.4 includes Figure 4, which visualizes the distribution of the latent variable E and compares it to the ground truth implicit causes. We will enhance the clarity of these sections by providing more detailed explanations of the ablation results and the interpretation of Figure 4.\n\n*   **Lack of reproducibility information (Section 4):** We acknowledge this is a valid concern. We will include the random seeds used for all experiments, report the variance (standard deviations) across multiple runs, and provide links to our code and data in the supplementary material. We will also provide a detailed description of the experimental setup.\n\n*   **Figure 4 and Tables 3, 4, 5 lacking information:** We acknowledge this. We will add axis labels and a legend to Figure 4. We will include standard deviations, confidence intervals, and p-values in Tables 3, 4, and 5. We will also clearly define all abbreviations in a dedicated section.\n\n*   **'Cogn skeleton' definition and notation table (Introduction):** We acknowledge this. We will provide a concise definition of 'cogn' when introducing the 'cogn skeleton' and include a comprehensive notation table in the revised version.\n\n*   **Lack of discussion of potential misuse or failure modes:** We acknowledge this is a valid point. We will add a section discussing potential misuse and failure modes, including the limitations of our approach, in the revised version.\n\n*   **Dataset privacy and consent details missing:** We acknowledge this. We will include details on data collection, consent procedures, and privacy measures for all datasets, including the usage terms for the synthetic dataset, in the revised version.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n*   **More detailed comparison with SOTA methods (Sec 4.1):** We believe we already provide this. Section 4.1 discusses the limitations of existing methods and how our method overcomes them. We will expand on this in the revised version.\n\n*   **Ablation studies (Sec 4.1):** We already provide ablation studies in Section 4.2 and Table 4. We will clarify the presentation of these results.\n\n*   **Additional experiments and dataset details (Sec 4.1):** We will provide more details about the datasets used in Appendix C. We will also consider adding additional experiments, time permitting.\n\n*   **Code, data, and experimental setup (Sections 3, 4):** We will provide these in the supplementary material, as stated above.\n\n*   **Figure 4 and Tables 3, 4, 5 improvements:** We will implement these changes as described above.\n\n*   **'Cogn skeleton' definition and notation table (Introduction):** We will implement these changes as described above.\n\n*   **Broader Impact section (Conclusion):** We will add a Broader Impact section in the conclusion.\n\n*   **Data collection, consent, and privacy details:** We will implement these changes as described above.\n\nWe believe that these revisions will significantly improve the clarity and impact of our paper. Thank you again for your valuable feedback."
