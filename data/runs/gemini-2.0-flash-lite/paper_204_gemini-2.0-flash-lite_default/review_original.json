  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel dataset and the concept of 'vicarious offense' to study offensive content moderation in political discourse. The study highlights disagreements between machine and human moderators and conducts a noise audit. However, the paper lacks crucial details for reproducibility and requires more rigorous comparisons with existing work.",
