  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel dataset and the concept of 'vicarious offense' to study offensive content moderation in political discourse. The study highlights disagreements between machine and human moderators and conducts a noise audit. The paper has been updated to address concerns about reproducibility, figure clarity, and statistical analysis. However, the paper still requires more rigorous comparisons with existing work and a more precise definition of 'vicarious offense'.",
